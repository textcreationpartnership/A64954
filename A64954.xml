            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GReatneſs and Goodneſs, though more rarely joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not inconſiſtent. God himſelf is <hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> the Higheſt and the Beſt of Beings. Magiſtrates that are good, do beſt deſerve the Name of <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth. <hi>Pſal. 82. 6. I ſaid ye are Gods, but ye ſhall dye like Men.</hi> And when
<pb facs="tcp:95461:3"/> Death ſeizes on them, their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is buried with them, but their goodneſs accompanies them into <hi>another</hi> World, and in <hi>this</hi> World perpetuates their Names, and makes their Memory Bleſſed. Rich men ought not to be High minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches. Wealth is but as it were <hi>a Caſtle in the Air;</hi> and a <hi>High Wall</hi> in the conceit and fancy of him that has it. The <hi>Rich man</hi> therefore <hi>is to rejoyce that he is made low, becauſe as the flower of the Graſs he ſhall paſs away,</hi> Jam. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Good Sir,</p>
            <p>Weigh this World but in the right Scales, and it will be found a <hi>Drop, a Small Duſt,</hi> as the Prophets phraſe is.</p>

            <p>In this degenerate Age, wherein Sin is ſo much in faſhion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Mode of the Times; it is matter of rejoycing, to ſee ſome Great men ſtriving againſt the ſtream, and manifeſting to all that they are not afraid or aſhamed of being Religious. I wiſh more Great Men were good, and that all good men were a great deal better! <hi>Times</hi> would quickly alter with <hi>Manners,</hi> and if more would lead good Lives, more would ſee good days.</p>
            <p>Go on I beſeech you Sir! To ſtand up for <hi>God,</hi> and for your <hi>Country.</hi> God and your Country
<pb facs="tcp:95461:4"/> will ſtand by you. It is your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that you are a firm Proteſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, and againſt Atheiſm alſo and Prophaneneſs; and that both in Word and Converſation.</p>
            <p>Go on to be Faithful, in that great Truſt which moſt deſervedly is repoſed in you; and to be <hi>a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Treaſure</hi> to your beloved City, then that you are keeper of; Go on to a Father to Orphans, a Patron to Apprentices, a Friend to Maſters, and one of the Darlings of <hi>London.</hi> May you live long to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>TIS an Argument of ſufficient strength, to prove that Man has loſt his underſtanding by his ſin, that he is ſo</hi> unconcern'd about Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>ſo fearleſſe of Eternal Ruine, ſo negligent of Everlaſting Salvation; though prudent in ſecular and ſmaller matters, yet he is perfectly</hi> phrantick <hi>in the greateſt and moſt weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of another World. If a man have a trial at Law is he thoughtful of the iſſue.
<pb facs="tcp:95461:6"/> The Malefactour who is to be tried for his Life, is ſollicitous about the Judges ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But though All muſt be tried and judged at the great Tribunal of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, yet few, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few regard it, or think before hand what is like to be their</hi> unalterable Doom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How truly lamentable is it, that</hi> Souls <hi>ſhould be thus drown'd in fleſh and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuallity! So blinded by the Prince of Darkneſs, as not to conſider what is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become of themſelves: What muſt be their</hi> next Home, <hi>when once they leave their preſent</hi> Tabernacle <hi>which is continually decaying, and muſt fall down quickly, may fall down ſuddenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prove thy ſelf is certainly thy Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Ignorance of ſins evil, makes ſin damnable; ignorance of Satans wiles and devices makes them ſucceſsful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
<pb facs="tcp:95461:6"/> ignorance of a bad estate makes it ſo much the worſe becauſe 'tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it ſhould be changed; and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Grace that is in us keeps the Conſcience, and Heart upon the Rack: Satan is gratified, and the Comfort of the Spirit is refuſed.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſum of true Wiſdom, as One obſerves does conſiſt in two things, <hi>Dei cognitione, &amp; noſtri,</hi> in the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>our ſelves:</hi> now to make us wiſe in both theſe reſpects, is one great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the holy Scriptures. He that is a ſtranger unto <hi>God,</hi> muſt needs be a ſtranger unto Reſt and Satisfaction, and is ignorant of Him who is the Higheſt and Chiefeſt good of all. He that is a ſtranger to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> muſt needs remain both ſinful and miſerable, and yet both <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> are unperceived; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95461:10"/> ignorance how <hi>Bad</hi> he is, fixes him in a ſtate that is not good; and makes it the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that ever it ſhould be better'd. No wonder therefore that the Apoſtle does put all upon the Examination and <hi>proving of themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Counſel is very proper both to <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and to <hi>Saints.</hi> Firſt 'tis proper to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for if they come to underſtand aright their own deplorable and wretched caſe; this would be one large ſtep from <hi>ſin to Grace.</hi> Secondly, 'tis proper alſo to Saints; for proving of themſelves will be the way to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the ſaving change that hath been wrought in them, and will be a large ſtep from <hi>Grace to Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A duty and that is <hi>to prove;</hi> the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which is uſed by Authors for the proving of Gold in the fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Iſocrat.</hi> Now Gold is proved in the fire in order to its diſcovery that 'tis true Gold, and that the droſs may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it. So the proving in the Text muſt be in order unto a <hi>diſcovery;</hi> and in order unto <hi>greater ſanctification and purity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95461:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. <hi>Whom</hi> is it our duty to prove? <hi>Our own ſelves.</hi> In reference to others we are to <hi>hope and believe all things,</hi> as far as is conſiſtent with the apparent fruits they bring forth, and the faithfulneſs which we owe them. But in reference to our ſelves: the greater ſeverity, commonly the greater ſincerity. We muſt watch and be jealous over our ſelves, leſt we be miſtaken and deceived in, and by our ſelves. And if you ask me. <hi>What we are to prove our ſelves about?</hi> The context informs us. Whether <hi>we are in the Faith?</hi> Whether <hi>Chriſt be in us yea, or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> I raiſe from the words is this. <hi>It highly concerns all to examine and prove themſelves:</hi> this duty is very much urged in the verſe where the Text lies. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Prove your own ſelves,</hi> the Counſel is doubled; which ſhews the great concernment of it, together with the difficulty and backwardneſs in us all to follow it: therefore he adds, as if he did half chide; <hi>What! Know you not your own ſelves?</hi> q. d. To be ignorant of your ſelves, your actions, and your ſtate, for want of ſelf-trial, is your <hi>Sin and ſhame;</hi> and argues prodigious carleſneſs to be in you, and you to be in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible danger.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95461:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall Firſt tell you, <hi>what is implied in this proving of our ſelves.</hi> Secondly, <hi>what of our ſelves is to be proved.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>concerning what we are to prove our ſelves.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the Manner how we are to do it.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>by what Rule and Touchſtone this proof of our ſelves is to be made.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>the ſpecial times and ſeaſons when this duty is to be done.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>lay down the reaſons perſuading to the practice of it.</hi> Eighthly, <hi>reſolve ſeveral Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience relating to this ſubject.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>cloſe with the Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to tell you, <hi>What is implied</hi> in this proving of our ſelves, and here ſeveral propoſitions are to be premiſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Children of men <hi>do owe obedience unto God as their rightful Lord and Governour;</hi> and conſequently it concerns them to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>whether the Lord has been obeyed, or other Lords have had, and ſtill have the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them.</hi> Man did not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither is he able to perſerve himſelf; and he is fartheſt off from being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem and ſave himſelf: therefore man is not his own, 'tis impious in him to ſpeak that language. Pſal. 12. 4. <hi>Who is Lord over me?</hi> But that God who gave him his being, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95461:11"/> holds his ſoul in life, and alone can redeem and ſave his ſoul from wrath, does juſtly lay claim to him as his ſubject, and require obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sons of men <hi>are under a law,</hi> which they are obliged to keep as a rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. God himſelf has given them a law, <hi>which is holy juſt and good,</hi> they are therefore to examine <hi>what reſpect they have had to this law.</hi> Whether it has been kept as it ought, like the <hi>apple of the eye?</hi> Or whether it has been hated and broken and caſt behind the back? For ſincere obedience and life, and death and diſobedience are joyned together. <hi>Deut. 30. 19, 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are all of us not only under a law, but <hi>under the eye of our Lord and Law-giver</hi> continually. <hi>He compaſſes our path and our lying down, and is acquainted with all our ways.</hi> Pſal. 139. 3. And ſhall we be ignorant of our own ways? <hi>His eyes behold, his eye-lids try the children of men.</hi> Pſal. 11. 4. When we would look more intently, our eye-lids are more contracted. <hi>Gods eye-lids</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to ſignifie how intently he eyes, when he tries the Children of men; and ſhall not they prove and try themſelves?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95461:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. Naturally we are <hi>prone to nothing but what is contrary to that Law and Rule we ſhould walk by.</hi> The Apoſtle ſticks not to ſay, that <hi>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.</hi> Rom. 8. 7. And as the heart of man is <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> ſo 'tis deceitful above all things, and it manifeſts its deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in concealing and hiding, that it may hold faſt its wickedneſs. Thoſe that have <hi>ſuch hearts,</hi> how jealous ſhould they be of them? How careful to prove, and to pry into them? And ſuppoſe there be a new nature given, yet upon proof 'twill be found that there is too too much of the old remaining.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We are <hi>endued with a power of ſelf-refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> and may take notice both of our hearts &amp; actions. There is a law written in our hearts by nature, which does in part diſcover what we ſhould do, and be; but the Word of God much more fully informs us of our duty. We may erect a Bar or Tribunal in our own ſouls, and call our ſelves before it. Conſcience can firſt be Witneſs, and afterwards a Judge. And truly a right judging of our ſelves is one way to eſcape, being condemned with the world. <hi>1 Cor. 11. 31.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. All muſt be Summoned <hi>to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95461:12"/> of themſelves unto God at laſt.</hi> Rom. 14. 12. <hi>So then every one of us muſt give accout of himſelf unto God.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, whether it be good or evil.</hi> Should we not then try and prove our ſelves before hand, repent of our evil deeds, believe in the Mediator, and throughly amend our doings, that we may be found of our Lord and Judge, in peace?</p>
            <p>Theſe propoſitions premiſed, I ſhall open the nature of this duty of ſelf-proving.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Self-proving implies a <hi>ſerious Inquiſition, and Search into our ſelves.</hi> Pſal. 77. 6. <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with my own heart, and my ſpirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> And truly a diligent ſearch is but needful; for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves. <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de profundum eſt homo.</hi> Man is a great deep, and therefore 'tis difficult for a man to ſound himſelf, and to come to the bottom of his own heart. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the ſecrets of nature, and ſays, <hi>there is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the Vultures eye,</hi> though it be ſo piercing <hi>hath not ſeen.</hi> Job. 28. 7. But the ſecrets of the heart are more abſtruſe, and hard to be found out. The Heathen Poet adviſed <hi>Tecum habita.</hi> Dwell with thy ſelf;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95461:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> our thoughts ſhould dwell much upon our ſelves, that we may find out the utmoſt of our ſelves. Our whole man is to fall under our inſpection, our ways, our words, our ſenſes, our ſouls, are all to be lookt over.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Self-proving implies, <hi>a fear of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</hi> The Apoſtle cautions againſt being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by man, <hi>Eph. 5. 6. Let no man deceive you with vain words;</hi> againſt being beguiled by Satan, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 3. But I fear leſt by any means as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his ſubtlety, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo againſt ſelf-deceit, <hi>1 Cor. 3. 18. Let no man deceive himſelf.</hi> He that is not jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over himſelf will eaſily miſtake, and may go out of the World miſtaken, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death the miſtake will be impoſſible to be corrected; we muſt therefore take heed to our ſelves that our ſpirits deal not treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Self proving implies, <hi>uſing the Light of the Word of God.</hi> This Word is <hi>quick and powerful;</hi> and as the Anatomiſts Knife, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects all the parts of the Body, and lays even the inmoſt of them open unto view: ſo the Word like <hi>a ſharp and two edged Sword,</hi> does pierce through all, and divides <hi>between Soul
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95461:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Spirit, i. e.</hi> between Nature and Grace, for the natural man is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; or the meaning may be, that the Word diſcovers not only the corruption in the Affections, and the inferior faculties of the Soul; but alſo that depravation and ſin, which is in the faculties which are Superior, and <hi>diſcerns what the intents and thoughts</hi> and reaſonings of the heart are, <hi>Heb. 4. 12.</hi> Unleſs we make uſe of the light of the Word we ſhall be loſt in the dark, while ſearching our ſelves. The Word makes manifeſt the very ſecrets of the heart, and hereby 'tis plain that God who ſearches the heart is the Author of this Word, and does accompany it, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.</hi> We find an Hearer <hi>convinced of all, and judged of all; the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt, and worſhipping God, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges God is in the Preachers of a Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Self-proving implies, <hi>comparing our ſelves with that Rule whereunto we ought to be conformed.</hi> The Commands of God lay an obligation upon the whole man. We are required to <hi>cleanſe our hands, and purifie our hearts,</hi> Jam. 4. 8. We muſt be holy in all manner of Converſation, and our affections muſt be ſet on things above, not on Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; our Minds alſo and Conſciences
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95461:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt be purged from their defilements. Now a compariſon is to be made between, what <hi>we ſhould be,</hi> and what <hi>we are.</hi> This bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to the right Rule, will diſcover our obliquities, and cauſe us the better to underſtand our ſelves. The Apoſtle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe condemns the folly of them; <hi>Who meaſure themſelves by themſelves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves among themſelves.</hi> Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Vivendum eſt regulis,</hi> we muſt walk by Rule and that is the Word, and by the Word we muſt at laſt be judged, therefore 'tis our wiſdom to ſee whether heart, and life are agreeable to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Self-proving implies, <hi>Self-accuſing and ſelf-condemning for what is evil.</hi> Upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation having found out our iniquities, we muſt hold up our guilty hands at Gods Bar, and acknowledge all we know: all that Satan can juſtly lay to our charge; Nay, all that is down in the Book of Gods own remembrance, <hi>Pſal. 51. 3. I acknowledge my iniquity and my ſin is ever before me.</hi> And as upon the diſcovery of ſin we are to be our own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, ſo alſo to judge and condemn our ſelves. We muſt readily juſtifie the Lord in the greateſt ſeverities at preſent; nay, we muſt acquit him upon ſuppoſition of eternal ſeverity, if he ſhould make us to feel his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95461:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> wrath, and greateſt indignation for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Self-proving implies, <hi>approving and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king comfort in that grace and goodneſs that has been wrought in us by the Spirit.</hi> As we are to be ſtrict in the ſearch after <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo <hi>grace</hi> is in no wiſe to be overlookt. The leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true grace, is great matter of praiſe, nay, will occaſion eternal thanksgiving, God does not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, neither ſhould we, but muſt own the good things, <hi>though but ſome good things,</hi> which are in us in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Philem.</hi> 6. Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after God, prizing of Chriſt, wearineſs of ſin, and longing to be holy: muſt in no wiſe be unobſerved in this work of Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Self-proving will never be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>unleſs there be a crying unto the Lord himſelf, to ſearch us;</hi> that we may not paſs a wrong judgment upon our ſelves. What depth is there that He cannot fathom? What can be concealed from him who knows all things? <hi>Jer. 17. 10. I the Lord ſearch the heart:</hi> though 'tis deceitful above all things, it cannot deceive me, <hi>I try the Reins. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> therefore prays, <hi>Examine me O Lord, and prove me, try my Reins and my Heart,</hi> Pſal. 26. 2. and <hi>Pſal. 139. 23, 24. Search me O
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95461:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> God and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way ever laſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I am to ſhew what of our ſelves is to be proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to examine and prove, <hi>what is our common and allowed practice.</hi> A Sanguine man is not denominated Pale as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, when he is Pale through fear; nor a Pale man Sanguine, when he bluſhes through ſhame. A good man may ſometimes fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is evil, and a bad man may ſometimes hit upon an action that is good. The Tree is to be judged by the ordinary Fruit it bears. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of his <hi>manner of life</hi> that it was <hi>godly in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 Tim. 3. 10, 12.</hi> But if it be our manner to <hi>be workers of iniquity,</hi> our doom will be at laſt to be <hi>excluded the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 13. 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to examine <hi>what courſe we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtill to take;</hi> If the wicked man <hi>will forſake his way and turn to God, mercy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and abundant pardon,</hi> Eſa. 55. 7. If the prodigal come home to his Fathers Houſe, he ſhall be received with joy, his former riot being forgotten and forgiven; ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95461:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the door of hope is open even to the ungodly man, if he will but deny his ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. But if the enemies of God will not lay down their Weapons, but refuſe and rebel ſtill, this argues the ſtate to be bad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to be near: the Lord may quickly come to a reſolution <hi>to eaſe himſelf of ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> Eſa. 1. 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt examine <hi>what company is moſt acceptable to us.</hi> If we <hi>we love the ungodly who hate the Lord:</hi> if the wickedneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whereby God is diſhonoured, is not the matter of our diſlike, as long as they thwart not, but promote our ſecular and carnal intereſt; if we like the company of Fools, (and Sinners are the worſt Fools) well enough, 'tis a ſign we are Fools our ſelves; <hi>Fools indeed</hi> who venture to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and to go to Hell for company, <hi>Prov. 13. 20.</hi> But if the <hi>Saints</hi> are lookt upon as <hi>the moſt excellent ones,</hi> and delighted in as the beſt Society, <hi>Pſal. 16. 3.</hi> if we love them that are born of God, it ſhews that we our ſelves are born of him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt examine <hi>of what nature our Communication is.</hi> The Tongue is the index of the heart and ſhews what is in it. As <hi>evil Communications corrupt good manners,</hi> ſo they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95461:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> are a ſign of a corrupt heart from whence they proceed. A Tongue that is not bridled, but rails, lies, backbites, and is obſcene, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and prophane, is an argument that <hi>Religion is but vain,</hi> Jam. 1. 26. But when the Tongue, not out of any carnal deſign, but delightfully talks of the Word of God, <hi>when we ſit in the houſe, when we walk by the way, when we lie down and when we riſe up:</hi> 'tis a ſign the <hi>Word is in the Heart,</hi> and that the Heart is renewed and changed by the Word, <hi>Deut. 4. 6, 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt examine <hi>what thoughts as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gueſts are ſuffered to lodge within us.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of wicked men that <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. but wicked and vain thoughts are delightful and abide in them. Proud, revengeful, covetous, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and all ſinful thoughts, are <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> becauſe they are to no good end or purpoſe, nay, to very bad purpoſe; Now if ſuch thoughts as theſe <hi>lodge in the heart,</hi> the <hi>heart is not waſhed from its wickedneſs,</hi> and they will hinder ſalvation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. But if holy thoughts are cheriſhed, and there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in them, more of them are deſired, and ſinful thoughts are a burthen, which the heart is weary of, and does conflict with, and wiſhes their expulſion: This does ſpeak a gracious frame of ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95461:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. We muſt examine <hi>what power we have of Spiritual diſcerning.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel is hid</hi> from the natural man which proves him in <hi>a loſt ſtate,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. The <hi>things of the ſpirit of God are fooliſhneſs to him;</hi> and he counts it the greateſt wiſdom to ſecure things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. That Rich man, <hi>Luk. 12.</hi> thought he had been mighty provident and prudent, in <hi>laying up goods for many years.</hi> But if we are Saints indeed, we have a faculty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcerning and judge quite otherwiſe: and our judgment is this, and that judgment is true; namely, <hi>That all are fools, and poor and miſerable, that are not rich in Grace, rich towards God, and that have made no proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Eternity.</hi> God called the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Rich man a Fool, upon this ſcore. And as the Lord calls the worldly-minded, Fools, ſo after death they will call themſelves by that name, and curſe their folly everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We muſt examine <hi>what we elect and make choice of as our chief Good,</hi> and take up with us the beſt Portion. The men of the World are contented with a Portion here in this Life, here they receive all their Conſolation; they live as they think very well, <hi>without God in the World,</hi> and do not care to know, to ſerve, or to enjoy him. But if we are Saints we follow other Counſels, we chuſe the Lord
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95461:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> for our Portion and reſolve to obey him, <hi>Pſal. 119. 57. Thou art my Portion O Lord, I have ſaid that I would keep thy Word,</hi> we are perſuaded of his al-ſufficient goodneſs, which is abundantly communicative of it ſelf, and deſire him above all. And the Lord himſelf being our Portion, we are pleaſed we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, we rejoyce and conclude <hi>the lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places, and that we have a very goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We muſt examine <hi>whether our naturally beloved ſin be now loathed.</hi> They that are ſincere are made ſo wiſe as to find out their <hi>dilectum delictum,</hi> darling iniquity, or if more than one have been their darlings they take ſpecial notice of them; and though they are alienated from the whole kind of Sin, yet with more than ordinary vehemency they deſire the mortification of the luſt or luſts which were formerly moſt beloved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe have ſo loaded them with guilt, have moſt of all defiled them, and provoked the Lord moſt bitterly againſt them. <hi>David</hi> proves his uprightneſs this way, <hi>Pſal. 18. 23. I was alſo upright before thee and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> But as for thoſe who reſolve to ſpare their darling corruptions, they are unſound; theſe luſts will coſt them the life of their Souls. And are not thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95461:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> prodigies of folly who love ſin ſo well, as to be contented to be damned for the ſake of it! If <hi>Herod</hi> will keep his <hi>Herodias</hi> ſtill againſt the admonition of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, it plainly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that he is void of Grace, though <hi>he hears gladly</hi> and <hi>in part practiſes</hi> the Word he hears.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We muſt examine <hi>what pre-eminence Heaven has above Earth in our affections.</hi> A wicked man when he comes to dye, will prefer Heaven before Hell; but a Saint pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Heaven before Earth; and when his heart treacherouſly hankers after earthly things he checks and chides it; he goes unto God and complains of this, and prays to be made more heavenly minded. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the vanity and fading nature of earthly things, and chuſes the <hi>better and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance.</hi> 'Tis a ſign we are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and renewed by the ſame Spirit, the Apoſtle was, when we ſpeak his Language, <hi>2 Cor. 4. 18. We look not at the things that are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things that are ſeen, are Temporal: but the things which are not ſeen are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. We muſt examine what is <hi>our great End and Deſign.</hi> The wicked man is ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by carnal, ſinful, and worldly ſelf: World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95461:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> honour, pleaſure, and advantage, are the higheſt, indeed the only things he ſeeks. If our Ends are not right, we cannot poſſibly be upright our ſelves. Now our End ought to be the glorifying of God and the enjoyment of Him. <hi>Whatever ye do</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. This ſhould ſtill be in the Chriſtians eye and aim; And truly the deſigning of Gods glory is the way to the enjoyment of him, wherein our own glory and happineſs does conſiſt. <hi>Thoſe that honour God he will honour;</hi> whatever thwarts this higheſt, greateſt End, is to be avoided with the greateſt care: for we cannot diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or deſpiſe the Lord, but <hi>ipſo facto</hi> we degrade and prejudice our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We muſt examine, <hi>whether we are not grieved at all diſcovered defects and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and deſirous to have every thing amiſs rectified and amended.</hi> Though upon ſearch we find much out of order, nay nothing in ſuch order, every way as it ſhould be; if this be our ſerious trouble, and we long <hi>indeed to be turned:</hi> long to be <hi>ſavingly changed;</hi> long to be <hi>throughly healed:</hi> 'tis a ſign of ſome hopeful beginnings if they do but hold. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim <hi>bemoaned himſelf that he was as a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock unaccuſtomed to the Yoak,</hi> he found a great reluctancy in corrupted nature, and loathneſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95461:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> to ſubmit to the Yoak of God; he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, and falls a praying for converting grace: <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned,</hi> his prayer is heard, he is <hi>turned,</hi> he is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,</hi> he <hi>repented,</hi> he is adopted, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured at laſt of mercy; <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child? For ſince I ſpake againſt him I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him and I will ſurely have mercy on him ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 18, 19, 21.</p>
            <p>In the third place I am to inform you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what we are to prove our ſelves.</hi> And at preſent I ſhall only inſiſt on thoſe two things which the Apoſtle mentions in the Context. We are to prove <hi>whether we are in the Faith, and whether Chriſt be in us,</hi> yea or no?</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to prove <hi>whether we are in the Faith.</hi> Sometimes Faith is ſaid <hi>to be in us,</hi> becauſe it is a grace infuſed by the Spirit of God into our hearts; <hi>With the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. Sometimes we are ſaid to <hi>be in Faith,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to others that are unregenerate, who are affirmed to be <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> and to be <hi>in their ſins.</hi> And there is good reaſon for this phraſe, that the Saints are <hi>in Faith,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95461:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> Faith does <hi>cloth</hi> them with a juſtifying <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and is a <hi>Shield</hi> to cover them, and <hi>to quench all the fiery Darts of the evil one.</hi> Now whether we are in the Faith, may be thus proved;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we are in the Faith, <hi>Truths being firmly believed will be particularly applyed,</hi> our aſſent will be firm unto the truth of the Goſpel, as being of Divine Authority. And as we ſhall believe that God himſelf does ſpeak in his Word, ſo we ſhall believe that he ſpeaks to <hi>us</hi> in particular. This particular application of the Word, we read of, <hi>Job. 5. ult. Lo this we have ſearched it, ſo it is, ſee it and know it for thy good.</hi> A Medicine if not applied will not heal, and the Word if not applied by Faith will not profit, <hi>Heb. 4. 2. But the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> When Divine Commands are particularly applied, we ſhall look upon our ſelves as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to obey them, and ſubmit to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our <hi>great Law-giver who has power to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi> When comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and threatnings are applied unto our Sins in particular, we ſhall be afraid to allow of thoſe Sins which bring us under the laſh of threatnings ſo very dreadful. And as for the promiſes of God, being particularly applied,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95461:19"/> how certainly will they be accompliſhed!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Faith <hi>will be joyned with Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance,</hi> Act. 20. 21. <hi>Teſtifying both to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Hypocrites Faith is uſually without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he is ſtranger to godly ſorrow, and yet he is full of confidence; or his repentance is without Faith, he lies down like <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> under the burthen of his guilt and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs of mercy. I grant that weak believers have ſtrong temptations to deſpair. But the God of hope bears up their hearts by an unſeen hand, ſo that they neither deſperately deſtroy themſelves, nor come to this reſolution; ſince there is no hope but they muſt be damn'd, they will be damn'd for ſomething, and ſo run out to all exceſs of riot. If our Faith be true, Sin will be our grief and deteſtation, and there will be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a change in our minds and rendring our hearts unto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we are in the Faith, <hi>Chriſt is no longer a ſtone of ſtumbling, but exceeding precious in our eſteem,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6, 7. He is lookt upon as the <hi>power of God and the wiſdom of God.</hi> The wiſdom of God in contriving ſuch a way of ſalvation is admired, and the power of Chriſt to ſave to the uttermoſt is believed. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95461:20"/> counted <hi>all things but loſs &amp; dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. 'Tis impoſſible a man ſhould be a true Believer and not have an high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for the Lord Jeſus. His Perſon is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, He is the Fathers equal, his Darling, and <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory.</hi> He is the Angels wonder, and <hi>they all are commanded to worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. 6. He is the Churches Head, and ſupplies the whole Body with his fulneſs, <hi>Eph. 1. ult. And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church which is his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> And as the Perſon of Chriſt ſo the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>precious, 1 Pet. 1. 19.</hi> Ye were redeemed <hi>with the precious blood of Chriſt as of a Lamb without blemiſh and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot.</hi> His benefits are precious. True Faith counts Him <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any offence from being taken at him, <hi>Matth. 11. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Faith <hi>will purifie our hearts,</hi> Act. 15. 9. <hi>And put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> Faith is perſuaded of the holineſs of God, and that he ſearches the heart, and trieth and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpirits of the children of men: 'tis alſo perſuaded that only the <hi>pare in heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> or are fit to ſee him, <hi>Mat. 5. 8.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95461:20"/> No wonder therefore if the conſequent of Faith be a <hi>following after holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. Faith moreover takes notice of the End of Chriſts dying, which was that he <hi>might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and cleanſe his Church, and preſent it unto himſelf a glorious Church not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing; but that it might be holy and without blemiſh,</hi> Eph. 5. 26, 27. and hence we have a plae for holineſs which is very effectual to obtain it. Finally, Faith applies the promiſes of ſanctification, the promiſes of a new heart and of a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25, 26. Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you, A new heart alſo will I give you and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the heart of ſtone out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> And by ſuch promiſes as theſe, Believers who account them exceeding great and precious, <hi>are made partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and eſcape the corruption that is in the World through luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we are in the Faith our <hi>faith will work, and work by love.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95461:21"/> worketh by love.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>faith without works is dead, as the body is dead without the ſpirit.</hi> Jam. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Faith derives ſtrength from Chriſt, whereby we yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the will of God, as well as relies upon his juſtifying righteouſneſs. But all works will not prove the truth of faith: but ſuch works as proceed from love. We muſt pray becauſe we love God, we muſt hear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love him; we muſt live to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love him. There is a threefold love to God, of <hi>Deſire,</hi> of <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency:</hi> now though all that have true faith may not arrive ſo high, as to delight in God; yet all true believers do deſire after God above all; and they bear ſuch good will to him, as to wiſh him glorified more by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, and this ſhews the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their love.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Faith will <hi>be weary of its contrary:</hi> and we ſhall cry with earneſtneſs, that the Lord would help our unbelief. The man in the Goſpel was very much troubled at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and therefore <hi>cried out with tears</hi> to Chriſt. <hi>Lord I believe,</hi> i. e. I believe in part, and deſire to believe more ſtrongly, <hi>help thou my unbelief.</hi> Mat. 9. 24. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving injections againſt God, againſt Chriſt, againſt the Spirit of grace, againſt the Word
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95461:21"/> of truth: are felt as ſo many buffets and blows upon an heart that truly believes. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever deſires to have his Aſſent to the Word of God more ſtrong, that it may have the ſtronger influence; and that his affections and actions may be ſuch, as may ſuit his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving every ſyllable of the Bible to be true. He deſires his reliance upon God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and upon the promiſes, may be more firm and ſteady. And oh what a value does he put a well-grounded aſſurance of <hi>the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord!</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. If we are in the Faith, our faith <hi>will give us victory over this preſent world.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4. 5. <hi>Whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, even your faith.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is ſo wiſe as <hi>nihil admirari,</hi> to admire nothing in this world. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had but little of this world: and cared not for it when <hi>Satan</hi> offered him all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, he deſpiſed the offer. The Apoſtles were poor in the world; and yet the ſpecial favourites of heaven: certainly the world is not a matter of extraordinary value. Moſt Saints have had but little of it, and thoſe who have had much of it, have lived above it.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95461:22"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> by Faith deſpiſed the pleaſures of ſin, and the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and prefer'd even <hi>reproaches for Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>afflictions with the people of God</hi> before them. Though <hi>David</hi> was a King, and wore a Crown of pure gold on his head; yet his faith made him look upon himſelf as a ſtranger upon the earth. Pſal. 39. 12. <hi>I am a ſtranger with thee, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer as all my fathers were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. If we are indeed in the Faith, our faith <hi>will make the next world evident and deſirable.</hi> 'Twil prove <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Heb. 11. 1. Faith is the good and true <hi>Spy</hi> which ſearches the heavenly Country which is promiſed: and brings back word. <hi>That that Celeſtial Canaan is very glorious, that an innumerable company of Angels are there, and the Spirits of juſt men, and all made perfect, that God the Judge of all is there ſeen face to face: and there is Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, crown'd with and in his Fathers throne; that there is no need of the Sun or of the Moon to ſhine: for the glory of God doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> Rev. 21. 23. <hi>finally, that ſin and ſorrow are eternal ſtrangers, but there is fulneſs of joy and pleaſures for evermore.</hi> And Faith giving ſuch a report of the world to come, no wonder that 'tis
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95461:22"/> judged worth ſeeking, and that with an holy violence. Mat. 11. 12. <hi>The Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to prove our ſelves, <hi>whether Chriſt be in us, yea or no?</hi> Chriſt and Satan divide the world, all that have not Chriſt in them, Satan has poſſeſſion of, he is the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that works in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Now whether Chriſt be really in us, may be thus proved and diſcerned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>he has entred by the door of the underſtanding,</hi> we cannot be totally ignorant of him. True Faith cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge. Rom. 10. 14. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> We muſt know who and what he was, that undertook the work of our redemption; how elſe can we rely upon him? He is <hi>near a kin to us as Man,</hi> and is a <hi>merciful and faithful high Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> Heb. 2. 17. and ſurely he was able to finiſh that work which he undertook, for <hi>he is over all God bleſſed for ever, Amen.</hi> Rom. 9. 5. We muſt alſo know the benefits of Chriſt, that we may know what to rely upon him for, now theſe benefits are moſt neceſſary ſuitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95461:23"/> as pardon of Sin, adoption to be the Sons of God; ſanctifying grace, and endleſs glory. Nay Chriſt <hi>is all in all,</hi> and Chriſt being given, nothing will be denied. Rom. 8. 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>our very hearts have been opened to receive him.</hi> When Chriſt has knockt at the door we have given him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; it has been our ſouls language, <hi>Come in thou bleſſed Lord, wherefore ſtandeſt thou without.</hi> And this receiving of Chriſt is indeed believing in him. Joh. 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> The heart has been convinced that 'tis moſt highly rational to give entertainment to this Lord of life and glory. He uſes the ſtrongeſt arguments for admiſſion, makes the greateſt offers; delivers all out of the depths of miſery, and advances them, to be Saints, Sons, Prieſts, Kings, who ſhall Reign moſt gloriouſly and happily to Eternity, that do indeed embrace him.</p>

               </gap>f Chriſt be in us, <hi>the dominion of Sin and our Idols have been thrown down.</hi> When <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperour offered half his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95461:23"/> Empire to the Conquering <hi>Alexander: Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> gave this Anſwer, That <hi>in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was but one Sun, and there muſt be but one Emperor in</hi> Perſia: and therefore continued his Wars, till <hi>Darius</hi> had loſt both Life and Kingdom. In like manner there cannot be two Rulers in one heart. If Chriſt be there, no iniquity has the dominion any longer. Where Chriſt is he works a change, ſo that perſons are no longer <hi>fooliſh, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and deceived; they no longer ſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever has been idolized, be it profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, applauſe: now 'tis diſeſteemed that Chriſt alone may be exalted.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>we approve and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his Kingdom, as well as his Prieſthood.</hi> We ſhall like and love the Lord. Jeſus, as a Prince upon the Throne; conſenting that that Throne ſhould be our hearts, as well as a Prieſt upon the Croſs, and ſhall be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be more fully ſubdued to him. His Yoak is judged <hi>eaſie and his burthen light, Mat. 11. ult.</hi> Chriſt is really no hard Maſter, though the World think him to be ſo. They that are in Chriſt, and experience what kind of Ruler he is, and that he rules by a Law of Faith, and Love, and Liberty, are very glad of his Kingly Office. It was matter of praiſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95461:24"/> and thankſgiving to the Apoſtle that he and other Believers had been made <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light:</hi> and alſo that <hi>God had delivered them from the power of darkneſs, and had tranſlated them into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>his Word is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and abides in us alſo.</hi> We cannot ſlight that Word which diſcovers Chriſt and was the great means to bring us to Him. <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. And hearken what Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>If ye abide in me and my Words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what ye will and it ſhall be done to you.</hi> Oh with what gladneſs do Believers give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the Word, ſince they may have what they will if the Word abide in them! and this Word will rectifie their judgments, and regulate their wills, ſo that they ſhall will nothing but what is truely for their good; and what is really for their good ſhall moſt readily be granted. Now Chriſt and his Word abide together. But Chriſt is rejected if his Word be not received. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my Word, hath one that judgeth him; the Word that I have ſpoken the ſame ſhall judge him at the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95461:24"/>6. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>we have the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. The Apoſtle does ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate this truth that he aſſerts, the want of Chriſts Spirit undoubtedly ſhews there is no intereſt in him. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</hi> As all the Members of the Natural Body, are animated and acted by the ſame Soul, which in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner ſhews it ſelf in the Head: ſo the ſame Spirit which is without meaſure in Chriſt the Head, does animate and act all the true Members of his Body myſtical. Now where the Spirit of Chriſt is he enlightens the mind, opens the eyes of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he makes a new Creature. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſt away, and all things become new.</hi> The old <hi>Adam</hi> and deceitful luſts are put off, and <hi>the new man put on, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> This Spirit of Chriſt <hi>mortifies the deeds of the Body,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. and cauſes thoſe who are led by him, <hi>to walk in the Lords Statutes,</hi> and he fills them with <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſs which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the praiſe and glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. If we are in Chriſt and he in us, <hi>we ſhall endeavour to walk as he walked.</hi> He is the unerring Pattern; to be followers of Chriſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95461:25"/> is certainly to go right. 'Tis in vain to ſay that we abide in him unleſs in ſome meaſure we reſemble him: and long to be more and more conformable to the Image of the Son of God. The Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 6. He that ſaith he abideth in him ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> When we go about doing good; when 'tis our meat and drink to do the work and buſineſs of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father; when we walk in meekneſs and humility not <hi>rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing,</hi> but <hi>overcome evil with good,</hi> then the ſame mind that was in Chriſt our Lord, is alſo in us, and 'tis evident that Chriſt is in us of a truth.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If Chriſt be in us, <hi>we ſhall account it our happineſs to be where he is and to behold his glory.</hi> As long as we are upon Earth we are in a vale of Tears: Sin remaining we cannot be free from trouble; the remainders of fleſh and corruption will make us ſigh and cry, <hi>O wretched! Rom. 7. 24.</hi> But <hi>when we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Body we ſhall be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 8. and then we ſhall be compleatly freed from whatever is matter of complaint and ſorrow. Believers value Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven though the hypocritical and carnal are earthly minded. The Apoſtle propounds it as the higheſt comfort, that Believers ſhall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95461:25"/> certainly be with the Lord, and <hi>ſhall be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf prays for this, as the top of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples happineſs, <hi>Joh. 17. 24. Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> This he promiſes to his Diſciples, to bear up their hearts, and arm them againſt all fears and troubles whatſoever, <hi>Joh. 14. 3. If I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am there ye may be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place follows the <hi>Manner how we are to prove our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In Self-proving, <hi>Self-love and Self-flattery muſt be baniſhed.</hi> Wicked men are ſaid to <hi>flatter themſelves in their own eyes until their iniquity be found to be hateful,</hi> Pſal. 36. 2. that is, till puniſhment overtake them and throughly convince them, how hateful ſin is in the eyes of an holy and Righteous God. Self-flattery has undone thouſands; rather than have bad thoughts of themſelves, and their own condition, they will frame a ſtrange conception of God, and think him <hi>like themſelves;</hi> and 'tis ordinary to cry peace and promiſe ſafety to themſelves till ſudden deſtruction come upon them, <hi>Pſal. 50. 21,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95461:26"/> 22. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done and I kept ſilence, and thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf: but I will reprove thee and ſet them in order before thine eyes. Now conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver.</hi> We muſt therefore deal plainly with our ſelves and paſs a true judgment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſufficient time muſt be allotted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for this matter.</hi> What is our time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for, but that we may make proviſion and ſure work for Eternity. <hi>Qui cito pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciat, ad pauca reſpicit.</hi> He that judgeth haſtily, commonly judgeth amiſs. We muſt ſequeſter our ſelves from other buſineſs, that we may have a full conference with our ſelves; <hi>Commune with your own heart upon your Bed,</hi> ſays <hi>David, and be ſtill,</hi> Pſal. 4. 4. that is, when you are <hi>retired</hi> do this, and be at leiſure to underſtand what your hearts have to ſay for, or againſt themſelves. If we commune but little, but ſeldom with our hearts we may live and die ignorant of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Self-proving ought to be managed <hi>with all poſſible ſeriouſneſs and concernedneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Matters which relate to our Eſtates and Livelihood are minded ſeriouſly: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95461:26"/> we do not trifle in matters of Life and Death. But how much more ſerious ſhould we be in a buſineſs upon which our eternal welfare does ſo very much depend? A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about our ſelves and our Spiritual Eſtate would be an undoing miſtake indeed, and after Death 'twill be perceived and lamented, but 'twill be too late to rectifie and amend it. And how much will it increaſe our woe, to go out of the World with confidence that <hi>all's Well,</hi> and find our ſelves in Hell imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after our diſſolution, where our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will be ſo <hi>very ill and never, never to be altered!</hi> Our fear therefore muſt be the greater of being deceived, and our care the more diligent to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt be willing to <hi>Examine and Ranſack our ſelves to the very bottom:</hi> to know the worſt, to know the beſt, to know the whole of our ſelves. Travellers have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a great deal of pains and gone many a weary ſtep to view the greater World. Man is a <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> little World. And as in the greater World, there is <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> much Land unknown: ſo 'tis in this <hi>leſſer World,</hi> much of it remains undiſcovered. Curioſity acts the Travellers, in the viewing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Nations; but truly Neceſſity ſhould make us to take a view of our ſelves, becauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95461:27"/> Self-ignorance is ſo dangerous and damnable. We are endued with a great many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties: we have various affections, deſires, and inclinations; many imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reaſonings and deſigns. All theſe are corrupted by nature, and need be renewed by the grace of God. We ſhould therefore be the more ſtrict in ſearching, that Sin wherever it lurks may not eſcape our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that grace alſo may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All along, the <hi>aid of the Spirit of God is to be called in. David</hi> ſays, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? and whether ſhall I flee from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139. 7. <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. Surely then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can diſcover the deepeſt things in Man. 'Tis the work of the Spirit to <hi>reprove the World of Sin.</hi> He takes away the Fig leaves of excuſes, and preſents Sin naked and bare. He wipes off the paint that is upon Sin, and ſhews the <hi>exceeding ſinfulneſs of it;</hi> that it may be lamented and abhorred; He diſcovers alſo the truth of Grace: and he does both infallibly; His light and help therefore is the more to be deſired.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Self-proving muſt be <hi>preſently.</hi> Delays
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95461:27"/> are dangerous, life is uncertain: 'tis ſad to be at uncertainties, in reference to a future, a better life. Now is the time to obey the call of the Goſpel, and now is the time to make <hi>our calling ſure;</hi> it concerns us to be ſpeedy and to <hi>give diligence</hi> to do it, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10. Sinners</hi> had need to make haſte and to find out their ſores quickly and their loſt Eſtate, while a Phyſician and a Saviour is near them. <hi>Saints</hi> have reaſon to be ſpeedy in Self-trial for perhaps it may be long before a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded aſſurance be attained.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Self-proving muſt <hi>frequently be renewed.</hi> We muſt not take one, or the firſt report of our own hearts; but muſt call them to Task and bring them to the Touchſtone again and again. We muſt obſerve our ſelves, what we are <hi>before Men,</hi> and what we are in <hi>ſecret;</hi> when only God takes Cogniſance of us. We muſt obſerve what we are in <hi>good Company,</hi> and what in <hi>bad.</hi> And if we are good <hi>only</hi> for Company, truely we ſhall be bad alſo for Company ſake. We muſt try and ſee how we carry it <hi>in proſperity,</hi> and how <hi>under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> what we are in <hi>duty,</hi> and what we prove in the hour of <hi>temptation.</hi> A Painter if he will give an exact Deſcription of a City or a Palace, will draw a proſpect of it Eaſtward, Weſtward, Northward, Southward. So we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95461:28"/> ſhould often view our ſelves in ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in ſeveral actions, in ſeveral trials and temptations that we may be able to judge the more truely.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In Self-proving we muſt <hi>never give over till we have brought the matter to an iſſue.</hi> If we cannot ſound our ſelves, the firſt or ſecond, or tenth or twentieth time; yet we ſhould not ceaſe, but hold on the rather in Self-examination. The Woman in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which had loſt the piece of Silver <hi>did light a Candle and ſought diligently till ſhe found it,</hi> Luk. 15. 8. In like manner we ſhould take the Candle of the Word of God, and ſeek diligently till we find whether we have grace or no. Chriſt asked concerning the Tribute Money, <hi>whoſe Image and Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it</hi> had? So we ſhould ask, Whoſe <hi>Image</hi> we bear? If the Image of God be upon us, his Superſcription is upon us, and we really belong to him. But if the Image of Satan be upon us, he lays claim to us as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; becauſe in regard of evil, we reſemble that Evil One. Well let us not give over in ſearching till we know whoſe we are: Both <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are worth finding out; Sin, that it may be dealt with as an Enemy and ſubdued; Grace, that it may be own'd with thankfulneſs and conſolation.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95461:28"/> 9. After we have done all, we muſt <hi>look unto the Holy Ghoſt for his ſealing and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> As the Spirit by diſcovering Sin and Hell and Wrath, works <hi>bondage and fear;</hi> ſo the Spirit infuſes Grace, ſhines upon that grace, diſcovers the truth of it and works <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</hi> The Holy Spirit of God dwells in the Saints <hi>and ſeals them to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Eph. 4. 30. His work is to witneſs their Adoption, ſo that with confidence <hi>they cry Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 6. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of a twofold teſtimony concerning the Saints Adoption, the teſtimony of <hi>their</hi> Spirits, the teſtimony of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</hi> The Spirit of Believers comparing their Hearts and the Word together, may give a teſtimony that they are the Children of God; But if this teſtimony be ſingle, 'tis not ſo valid: as one Witneſs under the old Law was not a full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: This Teſtimony when alone, will be cavel'd at and contradicted by the Accuſer of the Brethren, and will be queſtioned by the heart it ſelf. But when the Spirit of the Lord ſuperadds his Teſtimony, then there is Light and Liberty; then Adoption is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; God is confidently called Father, peace and joy follows: the State is now clear'd, Grace is evidenced, and future Glory is upon good ground expected.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95461:29"/> In the fifth place, I am to inform you by what <hi>Rule and Touchſtone,</hi> this proof of our ſelves is to be made. If our Rule be falſe or inſufficient, our judgments of our ſelves muſt needs be wrong. Before I diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right Touchſtone, I ſhall lay down ſome cautionary Rules in this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt not try our ſelves ſo as to judge of our Spiritual and Eternal State, by the <hi>Moral Law taken in its utmoſt latitude and extent.</hi> By the Law indeed is the knowledge of Sin: and having diſcovered Sin it leaves the Sinner under the curſe and condemnation. <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> If therefore we were to try our ſelves by the Law and the exceeding bredth of it, all, even the beſt muſt conclude themſelves accurſed: becauſe <hi>in many things all</hi> do tranſgreſs and <hi>offend, Jam. 3. 2. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prays againſt a ſtrict ſentence according to the juſt Law of God; for according to this he knew it would go ill with him and all fleſh beſides. <hi>Pſal. 143. 2. Enter not into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy Servant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> And the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>By the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God! that <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt is preached unto us the forgiveneſs of ſins, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95461:29"/> by Him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, Act. 13. 38, 39.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When looking into the <hi>truth of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we muſt not prove our ſelves by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Grace in the higher actings of it.</hi> Some are but <hi>Lambs</hi> and yet are truely of Chriſts Fold, though they cannot keep pace with the ſtronger of the Flock: Such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Shepherd has promiſed <hi>to carry in his boſom,</hi> Eſa. 40. 11. Some are but <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> and yet are truely the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God as well as thoſe who are <hi>ſtrong men.</hi> If we look upon <hi>Abraham</hi> we find him <hi>ſtrong in Faith; believing againſt hope,</hi> and thereby <hi>giving glory to God,</hi> Rom 4. 18, 20. We find <hi>David</hi> rejoycing, and profeſſing that God was the <hi>gladneſs of his joy;</hi> and his Soul is ſatisfied and raviſhed with a ſence of his excellent loving-kindneſs, <hi>Pſal. 43. 4.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is fully perſuaded of the love of God, is got above all doubts and fears, and inſults over all, as being confident that <hi>nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate him, from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi> He is not terrified at Death, but <hi>deſires to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and to be with Chriſt</hi> which is beſt of all, <hi>Phil. 1. 23.</hi> But now theſe which I have mentioned are the <hi>higher actings</hi> of Grace.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95461:30"/> And if weak Believers ſhould try themſelves by ſuch examples as theſe, Satan would get advantage, and their doubts and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would but increaſe upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In proving our ſelves we muſt take heed of <hi>making an ill uſe of the falls of Saints,</hi> which are recorded in Scripture. <hi>Davids</hi> uncleanneſs, <hi>Lots</hi> drunkenneſs are no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove, that any may allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in filthineſs and intemperance and yet go to Heaven. Nay the Scripture expreſly ſays the contrary, <hi>Eph. 5. 5. For this ye know that no Whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous man who is an Idolater, hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, of God:</hi> and all <hi>words</hi> that would perſuade otherwiſe, are but deceitful and <hi>vain, v. 6.</hi> The falls of Saints are mentioned not to encourage unto ſin, but to prevent deſpair, and to encourage to repentance and returning unto God, when there has been a departing from him. And truely they are in a ſtate quite different from the Saints, who are only like them in their <hi>falls,</hi> but not like them in their riſing again, Righteouſneſs and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt beware of thinking it <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have eſcaped the more groſs polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World.</hi> When we compare our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95461:30"/> ſelves with the vileſt of men, and find our ſelves unlike them, this is not enough to prove our ſelves, or our ſtate truely good. It was not enough to juſtifie the Phariſee before God, that others were extortioners, unjuſt and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, but he was free from ſuch groſs and ſcandalous crimes as theſe, <hi>Luk. 18. 11.</hi> There are degrees of Sin as well as Grace. 'Tis but a ſmall commendation, <hi>Peſſimis eſſe meliorem</hi> to be better than the very worſt of all: we may be bad enough to ruine us for all that. The Phariſees were righteous and blameleſs in the eyes of men, but Chriſt ſaw how proud and how unſanctified their hearts were; therefore he ſays, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>providences of God muſt not be our Rule of Trial:</hi> We muſt not judge of our ſpiritual condition by preſent external diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. You find a wicked man <hi>in purple and fine linnen, faring ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> and a godly man <hi>a beggar laid at his gate full of Sores,</hi> deſirous to be <hi>fed with the Crumbs that fell from the rich mans Table,</hi> Luk. 16. The righteous are plagued all the day <hi>long and chaſtened every morning:</hi> when the wicked <hi>proſper in the World, and increaſe in riches and have more than heart could wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95461:31"/> 12, 14. If thriving in this World be all thou haſt to ſhew as an evidence of the love of God; thou haſt indeed nothing at all to ſhew as an argument he loves thee with a ſpecial love; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them; but all things fall alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked,</hi> Eccleſ 9. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We muſt take heed of a <hi>wrong notion of the Grace of God in Chriſt; which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage licentiouſneſs and preſumption.</hi> We muſt not look upon him as <hi>all Juſtice, Jealouſie, Fury;</hi> neither muſt we imagine him <hi>all Grace and Mercy.</hi> We muſt not look upon our Lord Jeſus <hi>as the Miniſter of ſin.</hi> Gal. 2. 17. for he was <hi>manifeſted to deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8. 'tis unreaſonable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>continue in ſin that grace may abound.</hi> Rom. 6. 1. We muſt be fully perſuaded that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. for if the neceſſity of holineſs be not apprehended, we ſhall entertain a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confidence in the grace of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our luſts at the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We muſt take heed of putting our ſelves upon <hi>the Tryal, farther than the Scripture ever does.</hi> As whether we can be contented to be damned that God may be glorified? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would be ſo ſtrict and circumſpect as the word requires, if there were no future
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95461:31"/> reward or puniſhment? 'Tis not good to make ſuppoſitions, which God in his word never makes. As whether if we might live here in this world for ever, we could be very well contented? Whether if God were to be enjoyed but for a time, we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that enjoyment, before an everlaſting fruition of the creature? Such ſuppoſitions as they have no Scripture warrant, ſo they but perplex them that make them. We muſt take things as they are, and not ſuppoſe them to be what they are not. And if things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible which are but <hi>temporal,</hi> are deſpiſed in compariſon of inviſible things which are <hi>eternal,</hi> it argues the heart is wiſe to make a right choice.</p>
            <p>Having laid down theſe cautionary Rules, I come now to ſpeak of the Right <hi>Touchſtone,</hi> by which this Tryal of our ſelves is to be made; and that is the <hi>Written word of God.</hi> Saints cannot aſcend into heaven at preſent, and immediately ſearch the Book of life, to know whether their names are there regiſtred. Neither muſt they expect that an Angel ſhould come to them as to <hi>Daniel</hi> of old, to inform them that they are greatly beloved. Neither ſhall the wicked and the hypocritical ones have an hand appearing as once to <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> ſignifying how bad their ſtate is, and how ſad their is like to be. But to the written
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95461:32"/> word all muſt repair, that they may know what to conclude concerning themſelves. Now the word of God gives us a deſcription and characters both of a <hi>ſtate of nature,</hi> and of a <hi>ſtate of Grace.</hi> The Priſoner at the bar which is tryed for his life, with what trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling does he expect the verdict of the Jury. When we are trying our ſelves in reference to Eternity: Oh with what fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſhould we attend what ſentence the word of God will paſs upon us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with a deſcription of a State of Nature. Now the Scripture pronounces thoſe in a ſtate of nature,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who <hi>have a vail of groſſe and black ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance upon their hearts.</hi> As 'tis <hi>life eternal to know,</hi> ſo it muſt needs be granted to be no leſs than eternal death, to be groſly ignorant of the <hi>only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi> How can we obey that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law, to love the Lord with all our hearts, or that great Command of the Goſpel, to believe in Jeſus Chriſt: if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both God and Chriſt there be a very groſs ignorance? Ignorance is commonly rejoyced in as an excuſe for ſin: but it proves deſtructive where 'tis thus liked. Hoſ. 4. 6. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge.</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95461:32"/> 2 Cor. 4. 3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt.</hi> And Iſa. 27. 11. <hi>It is a people that have no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not ſave them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They are in a ſtate of Nature, <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the report of the Goſpel.</hi> The word ſpeaks terribly againſt ſuch as eſteem the Goſpel no more, than if it were a cunningly deviſed Fable, who ſtand no more in awe of it than if it were not of Divine Original, and Authority; but meerly of humane invention. Joh. 3. <hi>ult. He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Mar. 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am He,</hi> the true Meſſiah, the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: <hi>ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> Hell is in a ſpecial manner called the portion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. If Jeſus Chriſt the only expiatory ſacrifice for ſins be deſpiſed; there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no other, beſides: but a <hi>certain fearful looking for of vengeance, and of fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are in a ſtate of Nature, that are <hi>reſolved workers of iniquity.</hi> Let the Lord be never ſo angry, and threaten what he pleaſes, they dare to ſin notwithſtanding.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95461:33"/> Children of diſobedience muſt needs be the children of wrath. Col. 3. 6. <hi>The wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Thoſe whoſe hearts ſpeak that language. Jer. 44. 16. <hi>As for the word which thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:</hi> but are bewitched by the pleaſure and gain of ſin ſtill to continue the ſervants of it; theſe are the perſons which ſhall at laſt receive the wages of ſin, death eternal. 'Tis a mad reſolution to be proud, and filthy, and unjuſt, and profane, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Goſpel commands to the contrary: 'tis in effect to give conſent to be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. <hi>2. Theſ</hi> 1. 8. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are in a ſtate of Nature, who <hi>under a profeſſion of Religion practiſe wickedneſs ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at leaſt regard iniquity in their hearts.</hi> How many woes does our Lord thunder out againſt Hypocrites in one Chapter! and at laſt concludes with a terrible vehemency! <hi>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> Mat. 23. 33. Hell is eſpecially prepared for the Hypocrites; as well as for the unbelievers. If our hearts and hands are full of wickedneſs, malice, filthineſs, and ſecret diſhoneſty; if we can
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95461:33"/> commit ſin delightfully and ſecurely as long as 'tis done cloſely, what do all our duties ſignifie? The Lord abhors both us and them. Hark how he ſpeaks to ſuch Hypocrites; <hi>Bring no more vain oblations, Sabbaths and calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with; it is iniquity even the ſolemn Meeting: they are a trouble to me I am weary to bear them. And when you ſpread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers yet I will not hear you,</hi> Eſa. 1. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are in a ſtate of Nature <hi>who are lovers of this preſent World.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. <hi>Love not the World neither the things that are in the World; if any man love the World the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> The love of the Father may be taken <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</hi> The lover of this World, has no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love to the Father, nor any intereſt in the Fathers ſpecial love. How plainly and ſeverely does the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Jam. 4. 4. Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes know ye not that the friendſhip of the World is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, whoever therefore will be a friend of the World is the enemy of God.</hi> Then we may be ſaid to be friends and lovers of the World, when we conform to the ſinful cuſtoms and manners and faſhions of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95461:34"/> World: living by ſence as the World does: and when in our hearts and eager purſuits we prefer the VVorld and the gain, delights and preferments of it before God, before Chriſt, before Grace, before Glory. Thou that in thy heart deſpiſeſt a Treaſure in Heaven, and really eſteemeſt Silver and Gold of far greater value: 'tis as impoſſible for thee while of this mind, to <hi>go to Heaven, as for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle.</hi> The young man in the Goſpel was of an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation: but he wanted one thing and indeed the principal to make him a real Saint, a true Diſciple; becauſe he valued his <hi>great poſſeſſions</hi> above <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a <hi>treaſure in Heaven,</hi> that was offered to him, <hi>Mat. 19. 20, 24.</hi> Of this mind was that worldly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who ſaid, He would not leave his part in <hi>Paris</hi> for a part in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are in a ſtate of Nature, <hi>who go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs:</hi> this was the fault and the ruine of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, they thought their own righteouſneſs ſufficient, and the <hi>eſtabliſhing of their own righteouſneſs,</hi> was their own downfal; a proud conceit of their own righteouſneſs hindred them from <hi>ſubmitting to the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. Truſting in our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs will prove as deſtructive to us, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95461:34"/> in our iniquities. If we think by our prayers and duties and deeds of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to ſatisfie for the ſins which we have committed againſt the Lord of Heaven: 'tis a ſign we do not underſtand the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, nor the nature and demerit of Sin, nor the imperfection of our very beſt ſervices. 'Tis a ſign of great pride, and that Jeſus Chriſt and our need of him, are not rightly underſtood; and thus being whole in our own conceit, or thinking we can make our ſelves whole, we ſhall fall ſhort of the onely Saviour, <hi>who came to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt,</hi> Luk. 9. 10. Who is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician not to the well, but to the ſick; <hi>Who came to call not the Righteous, but Sinners to repentance,</hi> Mat. 9. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They are in a ſtate of Nature, <hi>who are haters of their Brethern.</hi> God is <hi>love,</hi> but malice is one great part of the Devils Image. <hi>1 Joh. 3. 15. Whoſoever hateth his Brother is a Murtherer; and ye know that no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer hath eternal life abiding in him.</hi> The malicious man, <hi>Cain</hi> is his Brother, <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is his Father; but he is certainly a ſtranger and enemy to the God of love and peace. Let a man ſpeak never ſo confidently that <hi>he is in the light,</hi> yet <hi>if he hate his Brother he is in darkneſs even until now,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 9.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95461:35"/> ſo <hi>1 Joh. 3. 10. In this the Children of God are manifeſted, and the Children of the Devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi> True love will <hi>ſuffer long and be kind,</hi> it will <hi>not envy</hi> or be <hi>eaſily provoked,</hi> it will <hi>bear and believe all things:</hi> it will forgive and cover a multitude of ſins. But they that will not forgive others, 'tis expreſly ſaid <hi>themſelves ſhall not be forgiven,</hi> Mat. 6. 15. If ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes. Hatred of the Brethren is a black mark indeed; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the Brethren are hated becauſe they faithfully reprove, and for their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They are in a ſtate of Nature, <hi>who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace damnable Hereſies;</hi> being given up to <hi>ſtrong deluſions to believe a lye:</hi> This the Apoſtle tells us will end in damnation, <hi>2 Theſ. 2. 11, 12.</hi> I grant that true Saints may fall into Error, but the Elect of God, ſhall not finally be deceived in thoſe doctrines which are fundamental and of abſolute neceſſity to be believed in order to Salvation. True Saints do ſtill hold the Head, and build upon the Rock Chriſt, though ſome of their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be <hi>wood and hay and ſtubble.</hi> Thoſe therefore, who <hi>deny the Lord that bought them,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95461:35"/> and make light of the blood of Jeſus, the price of the Churches redemption, are none of the Sheep of Chriſt, <hi>and will bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They never were but in a ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>who are total and final Apoſtates.</hi> Such are compared to the <hi>ſtony ground</hi> and in time of <hi>temptation falling away,</hi> Chriſt ſays, they <hi>had not root in themſelves,</hi> Mat. 13. 21. ſo <hi>1. Joh. 2. 19. If they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt they were not all of us.</hi> The utter Apoſtate ſhall be fill'd with his own ways, and ripen himſelf apace for ruine; <hi>Gods Soul ſhall have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him,</hi> his <hi>drawing back will be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> Heb. 10. 38, 39. and his <hi>laſt ſtate worſe than his beginning.</hi> Thus the Word deſcribes <hi>a State of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place I am to deſcribe out of the ſame Word of God, and give the ſigns of a <hi>State of Grace:</hi> and to ſhew you what are thoſe <hi>things which accompany Salvation.</hi> Now the Scripture pronounces them in a <hi>ſafe and good</hi> eſtate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who <hi>come to the light and are willing to be ſearched.</hi> True Gold does not fear the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95461:36"/> Touchſtone, and true Grace can abide the trial, ſincere Souls upon this very account like that preaching beſt which ſearches moſt; whereas unſound <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not bear the words of the Prophet, <hi>Amos 7. 10.</hi> There is a kind of Spiritual inſtinct in true Believers which inclines them both to a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of themſelves, and a deſire to have their hearts laid open: whereas Hypocrites love the dark, and are contentedly, nay gladly ignorant of themſelves. Our Lord ſpeaks very plain: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20, 21. <hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but every one that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> Doeſt thou like the Word when 'tis moſt quick and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful? When 'tis moſt ſharp and piercing? Doeſt thou bring thy heart to the Lord, and ſay, <hi>Search it O God?</hi> Even throughout, and look into every corner and let no corruption lye concealed: let not ſo much as one luſt be hid or ſpared? This willingneſs to be thus examined and proved, and to have the reins and heart tried, argues truth of grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are in a State of Grace, <hi>who are truely contrite and broken becauſe of Sin.</hi> Pſal. 34. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95461:36"/> are of a broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> He that is indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite has been convinced of Sin by the Spirit of God, and has been made to ſee the evil in it, and the evil that will follow upon it: His ſin and his miſery have been perceived. He is grieved becauſe he has ſinned againſt the Lord, and wiſhes that his ſorrow might be more abundant, becauſe his ſin has ſo much abounded, and he laments over a corrupted heart and nature which inclines him to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſin. His heart troubles him which is ſo hard, as well as wicked. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes himſelf, he judges himſelf before God: he loaths himſelf in his own ſight. And now all ſin is hated, he will divorce the <hi>Herodias,</hi> and conſent that the <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſhould go. Nay the ſin which was like <hi>Benjamin</hi> the darling, is a <hi>Benoni,</hi> matter of the greateſt ſorrow. This hatred of all ſin argues ſpiritual and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtanding. <hi>Pſal. 119. 104. Through thy Precepts I get underſtanding, therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi> Sin ruines none but thoſe that love it. Thoſe that hate it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, implacably and to the death, ſhall never dye and be deſtroyed by it. Certainly thou art ſincere if thou hateſt thy luſts that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were thy Lords, and if thou canſt truely cry with <hi>David; Pſal. 119. 133. Order my ſteps in thy Word and let no iniquity have the dominion over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95461:37"/>3. Thoſe are in a State of Grace, <hi>who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> To reject Chriſt, binds all our guilt upon us, and fixes us under wrath, and 'tis in effect to refuſe Salvation. <hi>But to as many as receive him to them he gives power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. If Chriſt be rightly and indeed received; he is received juſt as God offers him, as a <hi>Prince</hi> to Rule, as well as a <hi>Saviour</hi> from Wrath: to give <hi>Repentance,</hi> as well <hi>as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins,</hi> Act. 5. 31. Chriſt muſt be received as an able Saviour, as a willing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as the onely Saviour; and the whole of that Salvation whereof he is the Author muſt be valued. When he is received, there is a conſent to caſt all that offends him out of the heart to make room for him: and truely all of Chriſt is welcom; His ſtricteſt commands, his mortifying and ſanctifying Spirit, his Yoak, his Burthen, his Reproach, his Croſs, are welcom for his ſake, as well as his Crown. If we do not ſit down and count the coſt, and firſt of all well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and then fully agree to the Articles and Terms on which Chriſt is to be received, we may eaſily deceive our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe are in a State of Grace, who <hi>deſire after God above all, and yield and give
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95461:37"/> themſelves unto the Lord.</hi> The Pſalmiſt was a ſincere Saint who ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee, i. e.</hi> none as my great help, as my chief happineſs beſides thee. And notice is taken of the grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the Churches of <hi>Macedonia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they gave their own ſelves to the Lord, 2 Cor. 8. 5.</hi> If thy eyes have been opened to ſee that God is a far greater good than the Creature, and a greater good to thee; and thou deſireſt and chuſeſt the Lord himſelf who is ſo gracious and alſufficient, as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the beſt portion, and art as willing to be <hi>his</hi> portion as to have him <hi>thine;</hi> this willingneſs ſhews thou art of the number of his people, and that his powerful grace, has been at work in thee. <hi>Pſal. 110. 3. Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> God is called the <hi>portion of Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſtyled <hi>the rod of his inheritance,</hi> Jer. 10. 16. God and his people chuſe each other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are in a State of Grace, <hi>who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs.</hi> Our Lord pronounces ſuch <hi>bleſſed;</hi> and if he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them they ſhall be bleſſed, and promiſes <hi>they ſhall be filled, Mat. 5. 6.</hi> Righteouſneſs <hi>imputed,</hi> is, and that with very good reaſon prized by Believers, and Righteouſneſs <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95461:38"/> is earneſtly deſired, they long to be made more holy; more holy in heart, more holy in all manner of converſation: to have cleaner hands, hearts purer; they groan ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be ſanctified throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, and to be eſtabliſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in holineſs to the end. Doeſt thou vehemently deſire to be bettered by every mercy? To be refined more and more every time thou art caſt into the furnace of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And to become more holy by every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance thou engageſt in? This <hi>Sacra Fames,</hi> holy hunger is in thee, and thou art bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thoſe are in a State of Grace, <hi>who prize the Word of God at an high rate.</hi> All that are born again <hi>deſire as new born Babes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the Word that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. Hark to our Lord. <hi>Joh. 8. 47. He that is of God heareth Gods words, ye therefore hear them not becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> With good reaſon do gracious Souls value the Word of God, for it is the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed whereof they are born again: 'tis the Food whereby they are nouriſhed, 'tis the Phyſick whereby they are healed, 'tis the Cordial whereby they are revived, 'tis the Weapon wherewith they defend themſelves againſt their ſpiritual Enemies; Finally 'tis
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95461:38"/> the main Deed they have to ſhew, for the heavenly inheritance. If this Word of God be underſtood, believed and received by thee, in the love of it; if thou deſireſt to be caſt into the mould of the Word, and in all things to conform to it; if <hi>Davids</hi> language be thine. <hi>Pſal. 119. 33, 34, 35. Teach me O Lord the way of thy Statutes, and I ſhall keep it to the end. Give me underſtanding and I ſhall keep thy Law, yea, I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart. Make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do I delight.</hi> This will argue that thou haſt a good and honeſt heart indeed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thoſe are in a ſtate of grace, <hi>who have the Spirit of Prayer.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſoon as ever tranſlated into this ſtate, has this Character, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> Act. 9. 11. 'tis more than probable, he had ſpoken the words of prayer many a time before, while he was a zealous Son of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: but now he prayed in Gods account, now he prayed in the holy Ghoſt. They that are hypocrites may excell in the gift of Prayer, God may be <hi>much in their mouths,</hi> and their expreſſions may be fluent and ſeemingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate; when <hi>yet he is far from their reins.</hi> But the Spirit of grace and ſupplication is peculiar to the Saints. Now ſuch as have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95461:39"/> the Spirit of prayer, their deſires are drawn forth with greateſt ſtrength and fervour after Spiritual and eternal bleſſings. They intreat the favour of God and fellowſhip with him, with their whole heart: they beg for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Faith, Fear, and Love, and every other grace, and that they may be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the glory and praiſe of God, and that being delivered from every evil work, they may be preſerved to his heavenly Kingdom. Thus the <hi>Spirit makes interceſſion for them, according to the will of God.</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They are in a ſtate of Grace, <hi>who love the brethren.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. <hi>Hereby we know we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> Now right love to the brethren, is love with <hi>a pure heart,</hi> and <hi>a good conſcience,</hi> 'tis <hi>a fervent</hi> love; 'tis love to <hi>all the Saints,</hi> though but poor in the world, though of a different perſuaſion. The image of God is loved wherever 'tis found, and the more of it is found, 'tis lookt upon as more lovely. 'Tis one thing to love the Saints, becauſe they are <hi>good natured,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>beautiful,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>bountiful,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>wiſe and diſcreet:</hi> and 'tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to love them becauſe they are <hi>holy.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95461:39"/> And truly if the more holy they are, the more we love them, and the more plainly they deal with us by reprehenſion and advice in order unto our progreſs in ſanctification and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: the more and better we like them, this is a clear and ſolid evidence of our being Saints our ſelves. Moreover, true Saints are of a <hi>publick</hi> Spirit, they are concerned for the whole Church Militant, and cry aloud that ſhe may be preſerved in purity, unity, and love, and may more than conquer all enemies, and come at laſt to be Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They are in a ſtate of Grace, <hi>who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end, and are not weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</hi> He <hi>that endures to the end ſhall be ſaved</hi> ſays Chriſt, and <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 31. The ſincerely Righteous ones, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all difficulties, oppoſitions, trials, tribulations, <hi>hold on their way, and they that have clean hands do wax ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> Job. 17. 9. They fight the good fight of Faith to the laſt breath, and by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in wel-doing they ſeek for glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and immortality, and at laſt lay hold on eternal life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Touchſtone of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95461:40"/> Word to prove your ſelves by. And what this <hi>Word binds on earth, is bound in heaven; what this Word looſes on earth, is looſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> If you continue in a ſtate which this Word pronounces bad, you will certainly be condemned; but if your ſtate be ſuch as this Word declares good, you will as certainly be acquitted, rewarded, and crown'd at the great approaching Day.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, I am to inform you of the <hi>ſpecial ſeaſons, when this duty of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving is to be performed,</hi> and the ſeaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ought to prove our ſelves, <hi>before we engage in the ordinance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> There muſt be a Spiritual life, or elſe there cannot be a fitneſs to be a gueſt at the Lords Table. A dead Corps ſet at a Feaſt, would be a frightful Spectacle to all there, neither could a dead body eat any of the dainties prepared. He that is dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, is not a worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, for he wants the grace of Faith, which is as the eye to diſcern, the hand to receive, and the mouth to eat the Lord Jeſus, who is the bread of life. The Lords Supper is not an Ordinance deſigned to work the firſt grace, for if 'twere, then none ought to be excluded;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95461:40"/> the greateſt Sinners are to be admitted to converting Ordinances: and there would be no ſuch thing as Excommunication in the Church of Chriſt. But the deſign of it is to increaſe, and ſtrengthen, and make more and more evident that grace which is already wrought. Therefore we muſt prove what we are before we engage. 1 Cor. 11. 28, 29. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf, not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought to prove our Spiritual ſtate, and examine our proficiency, and eye the preſent frame of our hearts. And though upon trial we cannot abſolutely ſay we have grace, yet if there be no black and apparent marks of unregeneracy, and only probable ſigns of our being ſanctified, yet we ought to come to the Table, that our Faith may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the work of ſanctification carried on, and our ſelves in that ſealing Ordinance, <hi>ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> Are we willing that every ſin ſhould die? Are we willing that the world ſhould be thrown out of the higheſt room in our hearts? Are we willing to receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> he gives forth in this Ordinance? Are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95461:41"/> we willing to reſign and render <hi>our ſouls, and all that is within us;</hi> even our <hi>whole man</hi> to <hi>him?</hi> If we can anſwer in the affirmative to all; upon our coming to the Table we ſhall be made welcome; whatever an unbelieving heart may fear and ſuggeſt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to prove our ſelves <hi>before ſolemn prayer and humiliation.</hi> In ſolemn ſupplication <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of it as neceſſary, that every <hi>one ſhould underſtand the plague of his own heart, when he ſpreads forth his hands towards the houſe of God,</hi> 1 King. 8. 38. Now the heart muſt be examined what it ayls, that the plague of it may be found out. The Prieſt under the law was to look again and again upon the perſon ſuſpected of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The plagues of the heart lie deep many times, and are not eaſily diſcerned, there muſt be the more heedful examination. And as we are to find out the plagues of our hearts, ſo all our wants and weakneſſes: and all are to be ſpread before the God of all grace, who can, becauſe moſt high, perform all things for us, and cure every malady, and <hi>ſupply all our needs according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ought to prove our ſelves <hi>after falls,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:95461:41"/> though believers ſhall never fall from a ſtate of grace, yet they may fall into ſeveral acts of ſin. And when their falls are more foul and ſcandalous; their peace is broken: The holy Spirit their Comforter being grieved, their comfort and joy takes wings and flies away. The guilt they contract fills them with fear, and brings them under great bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, their evidences are blotted, and their ſtate ſeemsto be very queſtionable. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns them to prove themſelves, that they may find out the lurking corruption that betrayed them: and that they may be ſenſible of the heinous nature, and high ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of the ſins they have committed: that being truly humbled they may cry with fervency for pardon and cleanſing, and that the joy of Gods ſalvation may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> after he had defiled <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the Wife, and murdered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Husband: he renews the Search into himſelf, he traces theſe filthy ſtreams till he came to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the original corruption of his nature; he is ſenſible what an impure and deceitful heart he had, and therefore cries out, <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. he found that his fall had fill'd him with anguiſh, and very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95461:42"/> much enfeebled him; therefore he prays; <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> v. 12. His ſin ſtared him in the face, and he begs that God <hi>would hide his face from it,</hi> and withal he offers the acceptable <hi>ſacrifice of a broken and contrite heart</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ought to prove our ſelves in the time of <hi>Spiritual deſertion.</hi> When God had withdrawn from the Pſalmiſt, and ſo far withdrawn, as that he almoſt queſtioned whether ever he would return again; and therefore cries out, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever, and will he be favourable no more?</hi> then <hi>he communed with his own heart, and his Spirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> Pſal. 77. 6, 7. <hi>David</hi> enquires, <hi>why his God had forſaken him, and why he was ſo far from helping him, and from the words of his roaring.</hi> Pſal. 22. 1. and <hi>Job</hi> under deſertion cries out, <hi>why haſt thou ſet me as a mark againſt thee, ſo that I am a burthen to my ſelf?</hi> Job. 7. 20.</p>
            <p>Spiritual deſertions are very uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe are the hours wherein the powers of darkneſs buffet believers, and unbelief, and deadneſs, and corruptions prevail. Saints therefore ſhould queſtion themſelves ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what they have been, and done, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95461:42"/> has grieved and quenched the Bleſſed Spirit, that they may lament their ſin, and loſs; and lament after God: they are alſo to reflect upon former experiences of ſpecial kindneſs, and <hi>call to remembrance their Songs in the night,</hi> and <hi>the years of the right hand of the Moſt High:</hi> and the conſideration of Gods unchangeable love, and his ſure and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, ſhould keep them from ſinking into deſpondency. Finally they are to obſerve the deſign of God in withdrawing, and be the more humble, diſtruſtful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, depending on their beloved Lord, and the more thankful and fruitful prizing the preſence of God the more highly ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ought to prove our ſelves <hi>in the time of affliction.</hi> So ſays the Prophet, <hi>Lam. 3. 39, 40. Wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the puniſhment of his ſins? Let us ſearch and try our ways and turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord our God.</hi> Conſcience is many times awakened by affliction; we ſhould not hinder it from being buſie and prying, but hearken to it whatever it ſpeaks to us. <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren made light of their cruelty towards their Brother for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when they were in diſtreſs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then they lookt into themſelves, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95461:43"/> they had a ſmart and ſtinging ſence of their own unmercifulneſs; and they cry out, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhould cauſe us to conſider our ways, and though ſins were palliated and excuſed before, yet then we ſhould acknowledge, <hi>we are verily guilty.</hi> When our ſin hath found <hi>us</hi> out, we ſhould find <hi>that</hi> out: and our Souls ſhould be humbled within us, and turn to him that ſmites us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We ought to prove our ſelves <hi>after our engaging in Ordinances.</hi> 'Tis good to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine before, what we want; and after, what we have gained. Ordinances are Talents and a vaſt improvement may be made of them, if we are not wanting to our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Merchants that drive a Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas when the Ships return, they are careful to examine, what is the produce of the ventures they ſend. So ſhould we in this Spiritual Trade, we ſhould ask our ſelves, what we have gained? And what is the produce of all our praying, hearing, faſting, praiſing? Whether we are ſuch wiſe Merchants as to gain the Pearl of price? Whether we thrive in grace, and grow rich in faith, rich in good works, for this is to grow rich towards God? And truely all the Silver and Gold that ever was created is but droſs in compariſon of theſe riches.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95461:43"/> To go <hi>to</hi> Ordinances and <hi>from</hi> them, as the <hi>Door turns upon the Hinges,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main juſt as we were: will turn to no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, nay to an ill account. We are not to reſt therefore <hi>in opere operato,</hi> the work done; but examine what light, what heat, what ſtrength, what grace, what peace we gain by attending upon God: or elſe we may live and dye like lukewarm and miſtaken <hi>Laodicea:</hi> who <hi>ſaid ſhe was rich and increaſed with Goods, and had need of nothing: and knew not that ſhe was wretched and miſerable and poor and blind and naked,</hi> Rev. 3. 17.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis not amiſs if there be <hi>ſome Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving every day;</hi> that <hi>keeping of the heart with all diligence,</hi> Prov. 4. 23. implies a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching and calling it to an account; and that <hi>pondering the path of our feet</hi> required, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. implies both warineſs before, and a tracing our Steps afterwards to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have been right or wrong, ſtep towards God or from him. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> an Heathen, adviſes, every night to ask our ſelves ſuch Queſtions as theſe;</p>

            <p>In the ſeventh place, I come to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perſuading all to this examination and proving of themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Satan is very ſubtle,</hi> he does endeavour to conceal and hide both Sin and Grace; Sin in the wicked that they may not perceive the evil nature and tendency of it, till it has actually and utterly ruin'd them; and Grace in them that do believe, that their hearts may be tormented with doubts and fears, and ſtraitned in thankſgiving unto God. Satan is a lying Spirit, and upholds his Kingdom by deceit and falſhood; His work is to fill Gods Children with falſe fears, and his own with falſe hopes: and he has many wiles and ſtratagems to do both; 'Tis good therefore to be aware of him, and to be the ſtricter in ſearching of our ſelves that he may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us nor make us call evil good and good evil. Let us take great heed, for Satan is the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. and will accuſe them to themſelves as well as accuſe them before God: he will transform a true Saint and make him look in his own apprehenſion like a meer reprobate. And as he is the Accuſer of the Brethren, ſo he is the <hi>Excuſer of the wicked,</hi> and makes them ſay they ſhall have peace till the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſmokes againſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95461:44"/> them, and eternal Vengeance overtakes them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>heart is deceitful above all things, Jer.</hi> 17. 9. as it is unknown to others, ſo it hides it ſelf from the view of the man himſelf: Need there is then of Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The heart of man will repreſent Sin as profitable, as pleaſant, as creditable and in faſhion, and that there is no ſuch danger in the commiſſion of it, but that 'tis time enough hereafter, and eaſie enough to repent and obtain a pardon. The heart will extenuate ſin after 'tis done, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the mercy of the Lord, but ſhut its eyes againſt his juſtice and holineſs; 'twill call any thing almoſt by the name of ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and from very weak and inſufficient premiſſes, conclude the State is ſafe; Such cheats therefore muſt be more narrowly eyed, and we muſt bring them to the Heart-ſearcher that they may be diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is <hi>no Grace but has its counterfeit;</hi> When abundance of Braſs and bad Money is abroad, there is the greater care to try be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take. There is a world of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Grace at this day. Many take <hi>themſelves to be ſomething when they are nothing, and ſo deceive themſelves: every one</hi> therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95461:45"/> ſhould <hi>prove his own work, that he may have rejoycing in himſelf alone and not in another, Gal. 6. 3. 4.</hi> that is, that he may have not only the good word of others, but the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful approbation of his own Conſcience, that his work is good and wrought in God. There is a <hi>precious faith</hi> that <hi>ends in the ſalvation of the Soul,</hi> and there is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit faith, that dures <hi>only for a while, and in time of temptation fails.</hi> There is a ſaving knowledge, which is <hi>life eternal;</hi> and there is a notional knowledge, which only <hi>puffs up him</hi> that has it, and makes ſorrow and ſtripes at laſt to be the more. There is a ſincere love to Chriſt that has a vehement flame which <hi>many Waters cannot quench, which no Floods can drown:</hi> and there is a love which is only a painted Fire; a love in word and ſhew and not in heart and deed and truth. There is a Zeal which God is mightily pleaſed with, as that Zeal in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas:</hi> and there is a <hi>Zeal not according to knowledge.</hi> There is a true Humility, which makes us like to Chriſt and gives the Soul reſt; and there is a <hi>ſhew of Wiſdom and Humility</hi> to be found even in the Synagogues of Satan and Antichriſt. All grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether in pretence or true, muſt be tried by the Word, which if rightly applied, is infallible in its deciſion.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95461:45"/>4. Many <hi>do actually go out of the World miſtaken in themſelves,</hi> ſurely then we ſhould be ſerious in Self-trial. The <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> becauſe <hi>their Lamps were burning and neatly trimm'd,</hi> that is, they profeſs'd and talkt high, and made a gliſtering ſhew: came with full expectation of admiſſion into the Kingdom. Therefore with confidence they knock and with confidence they ſpeak; <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us,</hi> Mat. 25. 11. But the anſwer is, <hi>I know you not;</hi> The Door con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectation is ſhut for ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and they are ſentenc'd to burn too in Hell: though their Lamps on Earth did burn and blaze in a glorious profeſſion of Religion. Some are brought in pleading with the Lord Jeſus, when He ſays, <hi>He knew them not; We have eat and drank in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and thou haſt taught in our Streets,</hi> Luk. 13. 26. As if they ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord! 'tis very ſtrange thou ſhouldſt not know us, None more flocked after thee than we did: none were more forward to hear thy Word; we were Gueſts at thy Table many a time; and yet doſt thou not know us?</hi> Hear their pleas, ſee their confidence of being let in: and yet behold them thruſt out unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hypocrites may go <hi>very far and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95461:46"/> but Hypocrites and miſcarry;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould examine and ſee that we go farther. An Hypocrite may have a name that he is alive: he may bend his Knee and lift up his Eye, and ſpeak as it were with the tongue of an Angel: he may pray and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie ſo as to gain mans approbation; but yet that which is <hi>highly eſteemed among men is abomination in the ſight of God,</hi> Luk. 16. 15. How far did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> go before his Converſion, he was of the ſtraiteſt Sect, and <hi>touching the righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs:</hi> and yet though his life was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, his heart was without grace. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites how far ſoever they go, do either allow themſelves in ſin, or place a confidence in their own righteouſneſs. If we would therefore go beyond them, we muſt grieve for all ſin and hate it; <hi>We muſt worſhip God in the Spirit and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3. 3.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To be <hi>unwilling to Try and Prove our ſelves is a very bad ſymptom.</hi> The decay'd Tradeſman cares not to be at home for fear of being dunn'd by his Creditors; neither does he like to look into his Books becauſe he ſuſpects that he owes more than he is worth: So unſound Profeſſors like not to dwell with themſelves for fear Conſcience ſhould fill their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95461:46"/> Ears with a dreadful ſound, and reproach them with their offences; and they are loath to ſtudy the volume of their own hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuſpect they ſhall find little but what is ſtark naught there. Sin is a work of darkneſs where the light is fear'd and ſhun'd, 'tis a ſign that ſin bears ſway, and where it reigns it will ruine. <hi>Joh. 3. 19. This is the condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather than light becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Though it <hi>be very bad with us, yet 'tis really good to know the very worſt of our ſelves.</hi> Hardneſs of heart and unſenſibleneſs of ſin is a very great plague, the infliction of which argues God to be very angry: but conviction of ſin is the work of Gods Spirit. <hi>When the Comforter is come he ſhall convince the World of Sin,</hi> Joh. 16. 8. Indeed if a bad condition were unchangeable, and there were no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between an unregenerate Sinner and an Apoſtate Angel, 'twere another matter. But the truth is, though our ſtate and hearts are both bad, yet both may be alter'd for the better. And if we are ſenſible that we are under the power of darkneſs, we ſhall be the more importunate that God would deliver us, <hi>and tranſlate us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> If we perceive that our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95461:47"/> hearts are old and evil, 'twill make us to cry with more fervency, that the Lord would give us the new heart and the new ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his new Covenant.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There may be great <hi>diſconſolateneſs where there is truth of grace, if it be unknown.</hi> The children of light may walk in darkneſs; the heirs of ſalvation may complain, as if they were near loſt: and the friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Heaven, may think and ſpeak as if God accounted them his Enemies. Hark unto <hi>Heman:</hi> Pſal. 88. 7. <hi>Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou baſt afflicted me with all thy waves.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 15. 16. Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, and while I ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtracted.</hi> Believers being made alive, are alſo endued with Spiritual Sence, and cannot be indifferent as to Gods love and hatred as others are; If they have not ſome aſſurance of the one, they cannot but have ſome dread of the other: they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prove themſelves, that they may <hi>know the love that God has to them,</hi> and that they may <hi>joy in God through Jeſus Chriſt, by whom they have received the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5. 11.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There is a <hi>day of Trial and Judgment appointed, and very near at hand.</hi> God has
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95461:47"/> 
               <hi>appointed a day in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Act. 17. 31. and truely <hi>the Judge ſtandeth before the Door,</hi> Jam. 5. 9. The <hi>coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> And if we cannot abide the Trial of our own Conſciences now, how ſhall we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the Trial of him who is greater than our Conſciences and knoweth all things? It concerns us to call our ſelves to a ſevere account, and believe in Jeſus that we may be juſtified, and then at that day we ſhall not be condemned. Let us watch and work, that our Lord when he comes, may find us ſo doing. Let us ſtore up Scripture evidences that we are his Children, and then we ſhall have boldneſs in the day of Judgment, and not be aſhamed before him at his coming. <hi>Gods Judgment hereafter will be according to truth:</hi> names and ſhews how inſignificant will they be at the great day. Therefore let us look to it that our graces be true, that as ſuch they may be found and own'd at laſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A <hi>well grounded aſſurance is poſſible to be obtained.</hi> Let us never give over Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves till we have it. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to give all diligence to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and by our calling, <hi>our Election ſure, 2 Pet. 1. 10.</hi> We muſt not <hi>caſt away our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95461:48"/> when once we have gotten it, but <hi>hold the beginning of it firm unto the end.</hi> Aſſurance of the love of God, of what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue is it? What a reliſh does it give to every Mercy! What ſweetneſs does it put into the bittereſt Cup of Affliction! How undaunted does it make us at the approach of the laſt Enemy! And with what courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to commend our departing Souls into the hands of him that has redeemed them.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Application, I am to reſolve ſeveral <hi>Caſes of Conſcience</hi> concerning the Subject I am upon. Now the Caſes will be of <hi>two ſorts,</hi> ſome relate <hi>to Sir and a State of Nature;</hi> and others relate unto <hi>a State of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with thoſe Caſes relating to Sin and a State of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 1. And the firſt is this; <hi>Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Sinners to continue ignorant of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict ſearch to fill their ſouls with trouble and horrour?</hi> Is it not a wiſer part to keep themſelves quiet while they are ſo, than to raiſe a ſtorm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that may not be laid in haſt? Now they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95461:48"/> receive their good things, now they receive their conſolations; now they can take their eaſe, eat, drink and be merry: they can feaſt and laugh and ſing, and time runs very ſwift being ſpent in carnal jollity. Why then ſhould they look into the ſtate of their Souls, and put an end to all their peace and joy and comfort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Sinners <hi>ignorance of themſelves and the wretched condition they are in, does but add to their miſery:</hi> Secure indeed they are in a ſence, but farther off from ſafety. It was the miſery of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that <hi>Strangers had devoured his ſtrength and gray hairs were here and there upon him, and yet he knew it not,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 9. Self-ignorance and carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity makes the hearts of the Sons of Men fully ſet in them to do evil, and cauſes their ſtate to be nearer a kin to deſperate. Such will fearleſly add Sin to Sin, and <hi>draw ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with cords of vanity,</hi> and <hi>treaſure up more and more wrath unto themſelves againſt the day of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>peace and joy can be but ſhort at longeſt.</hi> Pleaſures for evermore can be found alone in Gods Prefence: The pleaſures of ſin and ſenſe are but for a ſeaſon. <hi>Job. 20. 5, 8. Knoweſt thou not this of old, ſince man
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95461:49"/> was placed upon Earth, that the triumphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the Hypocrite but for a moment? Though his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency mount up to the Heavens, and his head reacheth to the Clouds; yet he ſhall periſh for ever like his own dung; they which have ſeen him, ſhall ſay, Where is he? He ſhall fly away as a dream and ſhall not be found; yea, he ſhall be chaſed away as a night vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Better <hi>their falſe peace which muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, ſhould be diſturbed by Self-trial, than that it ſhould ceaſe by their Trial at Gods Bar.</hi> The ungodly cannot carry a falſe peace along with them into another World. The rich man in the Goſpel that fared ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every day, carried none of his good things with him when he died: his pleaſure then came to a full ſtop; and we read of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he met with but evil things, torments, flames, endleſs and unquenchable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. and then the rich man ſaw, it had been better before to have broken off his ſinful pleaſure by Self-reflection and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though a <hi>falſe peace upon Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be baniſhed, yet there may a true peace be obtained in the room of it.</hi> Be not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95461:49"/> to look into your ſelves, though you find matter of ſorrow; for godly ſorrow worketh repentance unto ſalvation; They that <hi>ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy,</hi> Pſal. 126. 5. And Chriſt pronounces <hi>the mourners bleſſed for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Mat. 5. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Caſe is this; <hi>Is it not time enough hereafter for Sinners to ſearch and look into themſelves?</hi> Then when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and youth are gone, and affliction and old age are come? What neceſſity is there to put themſelves upon the rack preſently?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>longer they defer, the more afraid they will be to begin,</hi> and ſo it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done in this World: eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that delay will make the work more difficult and grievous. The larger the ſcores are, the more loath they will be to look them over; and the more peccant and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart has been, the more unwilling it will be to be called to account: therefore 'tis beſt to begin this very inſtant, and 'twould have been better to have begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin is ſo <hi>great an evil that none can be too ſoon convinced of it,</hi> nor too ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95461:50"/> from it: as on the other hand, Grace is ſo excellent that we can never be too early enriched with it; and aſſurance of the love of God ſo deſirable and delightful, that it can never be too ſoon obtained. Why ſhould there be a delay in the ſearch after Sin? This Enemy ſhould ſpeedily be inquired after; ſince if let alone, it may ruine us ſuddenly before we are aware.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Sinners <hi>refuſe to mind the Lord and themſelves in the time of youth and proſperity, God may refuſe to have any regard to them in the time of their diſtreſs.</hi> Now is <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time,</hi> now they may ſeek the Lord and ſearch themſelves to good purpoſe, but whether the time of affliction may be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time or no, is queſtionable. The Lord threatens <hi>to laugh at the calamity</hi> of ſome and <hi>to mack when their fear comes,</hi> and that he will <hi>not be found</hi> of them, <hi>Prov. 1. 26, 28.</hi> They that refuſed to hearken, and ſtopt their Ears and made their hearts like an Adamant Stone, ſee what came to paſs at laſt, great wrath came upon them, they were ſcattered with a whirlwind; <hi>and as he cried, and they would not hear, ſo they cried, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Zach. 7. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:95461:50"/>4. Why ſhould <hi>ſuch a ſhort lived creature as Man delay to examine himſelf? What is his life? 'Tis even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vaniſheth away,</hi> Jam. 4. 14. How quickly may Death arreſt him, and ſummon him before the Lords Tribunal? Some are well in one hour, ſick the next and dead the third; nay, ſome are well and ſick and dead the ſame hour, if not the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. Defer not then to look into thy ſtate and heart ſpeedily, ſince upon the ſudden it may be ſaid to thee. <hi>Render an account of thy Stewardſhip for thou ſhalt be no longer Steward,</hi> Luk. 16. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 3. The third Caſe follows, which is this; <hi>How ſhall Sinners that all their days have been careleſs of, and utter Strangers to themſelves manage this buſineſs of Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let them <hi>get alone;</hi> not to be ſpeculatively wanton, or project for the World, or to pleaſe themſelves with vain and proud and towring imaginations; but that they may ſeriouſly bethink themſelves what is likely to become of them for ever. Let them get out of the croud and hurry of worldly buſineſs, and ſhake off carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95461:51"/> and be at leiſure to underſtand their Souls condition. Certainly a Soul that is of greater value than all the World is worth minding, is worth ſaving.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the <hi>thoughts of God and of Eternity make them ſerious,</hi> eſpecially conſidering how much God has been provoked, and how near they may be unto Eternity. Time is poſting away from them, and Death is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great haſte towards them: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Death, they enter upon Eternal ſtate, and how ſad will it be if it be a ſtate of eternal woe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let them cry unto God for his <hi>Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Spirit.</hi> When the Spirit is given, (and truely the Lord is ready to give his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that ask him) he does diſcover that in Sin that before was not perceived: he makes Hell to become naked, and takes off that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering that was upon deſtruction; He holds before Sinners the Glaſs of Gods holy Law, that in that Glaſs they may behold their hearts and lives; ſhews unto them that the characters of Gods Enemies agree to them, and that <hi>their ſpot is not the ſpot of his Children,</hi> Deut. 32. 5. Then <hi>Sin will revive</hi> and <hi>Sinners die;</hi> that is, become ſenſible they are the ſons of death and wrath and in great danger of Eternal ruine.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95461:51"/> Now they are to hold up their hands and cry, <hi>Guilty, Guilty,</hi> and to lament and bemoan themſelves as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, to ſee themſelves in ſuch a loſt condition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let them be <hi>very inquiſitive what they ſhall do that they might be ſaved.</hi> Thus were thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were <hi>prickt at the heart,</hi> Act. 2. and thus was the <hi>trembling Jaylour,</hi> Act. 16. A loſt eſtate being perceived is not to be reſted in; none ought to be contented to be damned, but they muſt inquire what they muſt do to eſcape the wrath to come, and they muſt give themſelves to prayer in good earneſt, and uſe the other means of grace: and the ſenſe of their ſin and miſery ſhould make them the more ſervent in crying for that mercy and grace which they ſo highly ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 4. The fourth Caſe this; <hi>When Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon Self-trial have found out the badneſs of their State, is there any reaſon they ſhould deſpair of mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Deſpair is <hi>one of the greateſt ſins that can be committed,</hi> diſhonouring the grace of God, making light of the blood of Chriſt, and very oppoſite to the Spitit of Grace. <hi>It is good,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>that a man ſhould hope, Lam.</hi> 3. 26. Surely, then 'tis bad that a man
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95461:52"/> ſhould deſpair. This ſin thwarts the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel. And Satan being hopeleſs himſelf, would fain hinder ſenſible Sinners from hoping, though he cheriſhes vain hopes in ſuch as are preſumptuous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>deſpair that is a Duty;</hi> that is a deſpair of help from ſelf: and a deſpair of help from God, if there be a reſolution to continue in Sin. Thou mayeſt as well hope to get no harm by the fall in throwing thy ſelf off from the top of <hi>Londons</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument. Thou may'ſt as well caſt thy ſelf into the Fire, and hope not to be burnt, as go on ſtill in thy Sins and hope to eſcape everlaſting Flames.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet the <hi>door of hope is really open to the greateſt Sinners,</hi> that are willing to return to God and become Saints. Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> was let in at this door. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. you read of a ſad Crew, that if Hell were to be raked, worſe could hardly be found. <hi>Fornicators, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, Adulterers, effeminate abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Revilers, Extortioners,</hi> and yet theſe <hi>were waſht and ſanctified and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> Such inſtances of the rich and free
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95461:52"/> grace of God, ſhould hinder the worſt from deſpairing when they come to themſelves, and are minded to come home to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>conviction of ſin and miſery which ſenſible Souls have, is the common road to Chriſt and grace and comfort.</hi> He gives <hi>reſt to the weary and heavy laden,</hi> he gives <hi>liberty to the captives,</hi> and <hi>binds up the broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. Luk. 4. 18. When Sinners are brought to the brink of Hell in their own apprehenſion, this is an hopeful ſign, they ſhall be delivered from that place of woe and ſorrow, and that they ſhall not feel what they fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 5. The fifth Caſe is this; <hi>What courſe muſt Sinners take after they have prov'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and found how bad they are, to be brought into a better and ſafe Eſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They <hi>muſt not oppoſe conviction:</hi> but be willing, nay, earneſtly deſirous that it may be thorow, that their humiliation may be the deeper; they muſt not only be ſenſible that their actions have been bad, but that their hearts are a great deal worſe: that their very nature is corrupted, and their ſtate moſt miſerable. Slight convictions ſoon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95461:53"/> wear off, and a little ſenſe of Sin is followed only with ſuch <hi>goodneſs that is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away, Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. The deeper the humiliation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſtricter the holineſs afterwards. <hi>Piſcator ictus ſapit,</hi> the burnt Child dreads the Fire. And he that hath taſted the Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and the Gall that is in Sin, will be the more alienated from it, and afraid of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting new guilt and defilement. Let not the pangs of contrition go off too ſoon, for fear there be an abortive inſtead of the new birth: the more you are burthen'd with Sin, the more ſincere Converſion will be, and Chriſt is the readier to give you reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt conſent <hi>to caſt away every tranſgreſſion, and ceaſe to be the companions of Tranſgreſſors.</hi> Let not any Sin be kept, and rolled as a ſwee morſel under the Tongue, for 'twill prove as bitter and deadly as the very gall of Aſps at laſt. That promiſe, <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> ſhall not be your ruine, is annexed to a command; <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions,</hi> Ezek. 18. 30, 31. The wicked man is required <hi>to forſake his way,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the reformation of his life, and alſo to forſake <hi>his thoughts:</hi> which ſhews his very heart muſt be renewed, elſe there cannot be a <hi>returning unto God</hi> indeed, nor <hi>mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95461:53"/> obtained,</hi> Eſa. 55. 7. It is reported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Mother of <hi>Nero Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that it was foretold her, That her Son ſhould be Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> but afterwards kill his own Mother. She ſaid, <hi>Occidat modo imperet,</hi> Let him kill me ſo he may but Reign. Oh let not any Sinner ſay ſo concerning any gainful, delightful darling Sin. <hi>Let it damn me ſo it may but Reign.</hi> Let me <hi>die by it, ſo I may but live in it.</hi> And as ſinful courſes muſt be abandoned, ſo alſo ſinful company. <hi>Save your ſelves from an untoward genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Act. 2. 40. was the advice of <hi>Peter</hi> to thoſe awakned Souls that askt him, what they ſhould do. If you would turn to God and go to Heaven, you muſt leave that company that are reſolved to go on in Sin, and unto Hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt <hi>attend upon prophecy and beg that the Spirit would accompany it.</hi> The Word of God is <hi>the incorruptible ſeed,</hi> of which Sinners are born again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. and the Word is made effectual by the Spirit. 'Tis a very encouraging aſſeveration of Chriſt. Joh. 5. 25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and live.</hi> A meer man might have cried long enough and to no purpoſe at <hi>Lazarus</hi> his grave.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95461:54"/> But when our Lord ſays, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> there went out a power along with his word that raiſed him. Let Sinners attend upon the Word of Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf may ſpeak to them, as well as man, and then the Spirit of Life will enter into them; and the dead in ſin ſhall live.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They muſt <hi>look unto Jeſus for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength,</hi> Eſa. 45. 24. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt is neceſſary unto Sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, therefore God does not impute their own ſins to them upon their believing in Chriſt, becauſe he does impute the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his Son: That's a notable place, <hi>Rom. 4. 6. Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom the Lord imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs without works.</hi> Here is an imputed righteouſneſs, and leſt any ſhould think it a putative or imaginary righteouſneſs, 'tis called a righteouſneſs of the Lords own imputing: Further, 'tis a righteouſneſs that does not conſiſt in any works or obedience of ours. Finally, this Doctrine of the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt is aſſerted by <hi>David</hi> under the Old Teſtament, as by <hi>Paul</hi> under the New. In Sinners Approach unto God, this righteouſneſs is to be relied on for pardon and juſtification. And as his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is neceſſary unto Reconciliation, ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95461:54"/> is his ſtrength and the power of his Spirit unto Converſion. None will be made free from the power of Sin and Satan, none will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of darkneſs, till the Son of God does make them free indeed, and tranſlate them into his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They muſt <hi>cry unto God to be throughly turned:</hi> So did <hi>Ephraim, Jer. 31. 18. Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. Ephraim</hi> had the ſeal of the Covenant adminiſtred to him in infancy, which was Circumciſion; and therefore he calls the Lord <hi>his</hi> God, and has the greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to cry to him to circumciſe and turn his heart unto himſelf. And ſurely under the New Teſtament the Covenant is not made more narrow, nor our arguments and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements fewer to plead for converting grace. Let Sinners therefore beg, that as they have been baptized with Water in the Lords name, ſo they may be juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, ſanctified by his Spirit, and effectually turned unto God. Till the Lord does turn you, you muſt needs remain unconverted. And when once you are made earneſt that you may be ſincere Converts, you are earneſt for that which is moſt agreeable to the will of God, and 'tis a ſign that the work is already begun. There could never be ſtrong deſires to be turned, if the heart were not in ſome degree turned to deſire it.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95461:55"/> 
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 6. The ſixth Caſe is this; <hi>How far may Sinners go and yet fall ſhort of Grace and Heaven?</hi> This is of great concernment to be fully reſolved, that we may not be miſtaken in our ſelves, therefore I ſhall be the larger upon it. Many with <hi>Agrippa</hi> are <hi>almoſt perſuaded to be Chriſtians,</hi> that are not Chriſtians altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Many with him in the Goſpel are <hi>not far from the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> who yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come thither: the caſe ſuch is ſad, for they are miſerable after they were near to happineſs: they are like a Merchant that is Shipwrackt, and loſes all, and himſelf too, within ſight of ſhore: they ſail as it were by Heaven to Hell, and their being once ſo near Heaven, will make Hell the more doleful and intolerable. Now how far Sinners may go, and yet ſtill remain but in a State of Nature, I ſhall ſhew in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that have no true grace <hi>may own and acknowledge the Chriſtian Faith to be true.</hi> 'Tis affirmed of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that <hi>he believed, Act. 8. 13.</hi> The miracles that were wrought by <hi>Philip</hi> for the confirmation of the Goſpel gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſent, that it was the Goſpel of God and of undoubted truth. In like manner <hi>Nicodemus</hi> while a Stranger to Regeneration was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and did confeſs that Chriſt was a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſent from God, <hi>Joh. 3. 1, 2.</hi> Now as I go
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95461:55"/> along, I ſhall ſhew wherein ſuch as have no grace do fail, that the unſound may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their hypocriſie, and the truely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious may be the better able to diſcern their ſincerity. Though the forementioned perſons believe the truth of the Goſpel, they do not apply it to themſelves, nor heartily embrace the goodneſs of the Goſpel, but prefer their luſts, their pleaſures and their profits, before Gods Kingdom; their aſſent is weak and does not influence their Conſciences affections and converſations, and ſo proves ineffectual to Salvation. <hi>Jam. 2. 14. What doth it profit if a man ſay he hath Faith and have not Works? Can Faith ſave him?</hi> And <hi>v. 26. As the Body without the Spitit is dead, ſo Faith without Works is dead alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They that have no grace <hi>may ſolemnly be admitted into the viſible Church: Simon</hi> the Sorcerer was <hi>baptized,</hi> and yet <hi>Peter</hi> tells him afterwards, that he was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bond of iniquity, Act. 8. 13, 23.</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were circumciſed in their fleſh, whoſe hearts were never circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. <hi>Jer. 9. 25, 26. Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will puniſh all them that are circumciſed with the uncircumciſed;</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Edom, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>and</hi> Moab: <hi>for all theſe Nations are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed: and all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95461:56"/> in their hearts.</hi> How many by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are admitted into the Church of Chriſt, and reſt herein, not caring to partake of the Blood of Chriſt, and leaſt of all to partake of the Spirit of Grace and Holineſs which are ſignified by the Water in that inſtitution. What did it profit the <hi>Jews</hi> that they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in their fleſh, if after they did not anſwer their infant Cirumciſion, by a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ear and heart, and an holy and obedient Converſation? And in like manner, what will the being baptized with Water avail, if the filthineſs of Sin be not purged, but loved, and there be not <hi>an anſwer</hi> afterwards <hi>of a good Conſcience towards God?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that have no true grace, <hi>may be forward in profeſſion:</hi> and by talking at an high rate, attain unto ſome reputation for Godlineſs; thus <hi>Sardis had a name</hi> and fame <hi>that ſhe liv'd, and yet was dead,</hi> Rev. 3. 1. But theſe forward Profeſſors when unſound, drive on ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſign, as the ravenous Birds when they ſoar never ſo much alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at, have their eyes downward, and are looking after ſomething that they may prey upon. Under all their profeſſion, their hearts they neglect, and ſuffer them to be full of pride and paſſion and love of the World: they have no deſire after inward purity, and beſides they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95461:56"/> and wofully fail many times in their dealings with men, and in regard of thoſe duties which in their capacities and relations are incumbent upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They that have no true grace, <hi>may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in all the publick Ordinances that Chriſt has inſtituted:</hi> they may pray and hear, and be admitted unto Communion and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip, and yet not be the real Members of Chriſt, and be ſhut out of the Kingdom. Thoſe perſons had eat and drank in our Lords preſence, and had heard him teaching many a time, unto whom he ſpeaks after this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of Heaven, and you your ſelves thruſt out,</hi> Luk. 13. 26, 28. Theſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical engagers in Ordinances, ſeek not the Lord himſelf in his Ordinances; His favour, and the communications of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Spirit they prize not, they deſire not: and though Ordinances leave them as proud, and wanton, and unbelieving, and earthly-minded, as they found them; they are unconcerned; for to have better hearts than they had, is not any piece of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95461:57"/> 5. They that have no true grace, <hi>may attain to a great meaſure of notional knowledge.</hi> That Servant who was <hi>beaten with many ſtripes did know the will of his Maſter,</hi> Luk. 12. 47. <hi>We all have knowledge,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. unſound as well as ſincere. An Hypocrite may have great light in his underſtanding, but that light makes him high-minded, his knowledge is without affection to Spiritual things, his head is very clear, but his heart is very cold. He is acquainted with the truth, but he holds it in unrighteouſneſs. Is it not a ſad ſight to ſee Children that have the Rickets, with great Heads, but Arms weak and unable to do any thing, and Legs ſmall and feeble and unable to go? Here is the Emblem of one that knows the Word of God, but neither loves nor obeys it. A great head he has, but his actions and ſteps bear no proportion to to the knowledge he has received.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They that have no true grace, <hi>may attain unto excellent gifts. Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> were both Preachers of the Goſpel, and called upon others to turn to God, and yet were not real Converts themſelves. Our Lord tells us, that <hi>many will ſay to him in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name?</hi> And yet they ſhall be <hi>bid to depart from him,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95461:57"/> Many Miniſters miſcarry. Many fall into Hell from under the Pulpit, and our of the Pulpit; they are able to preach to others, and yet themſelves are caſtaways. Theſe unſound ones aim at their own applauſe in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their gifts, they hunt after honour, they prefer gifts before grace, and many times uſe their gifts amiſs, to divide and deſtroy, and not to edfie the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They that have no true grace, <hi>may have their Conſciences exceedingly awakened,</hi> and may be filled with the terrors of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Sin. <hi>Paſhur</hi> had the name of <hi>Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſabib</hi> becauſe of thoſe terrors where with he was ſurrounded. Oh what an agony was <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in when he ſaw that Chriſt was indeed condemned: and under theſe terrors there may be a confeſſion of Sin; <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſays <hi>Judas, in that I have betrayed innocent blood. I have ſinned againſt the Lord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you,</hi> ſays <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> But 'tis to be obſerved, concerning them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, that their troubles do either drive them to carnal means to remove them, or to deſperate courſes: or if they do ſeek unto God, 'tis but for a while, and they are glad when their trouble is gone, that they may ſin with greater freedom. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, they returned and enquired
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95461:58"/> early after God, but yet their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. 34-38.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They that have no true grace, <hi>may have ſome inclination towards, and wiſhes after grace and holineſs. Agrippa</hi> his heart was ſomewhat inclin'd towards Chriſtianity. The young man in the Goſpel had done ſomething, and was inclined to do more good that he might inherit Eternal Life, <hi>Mat. 19. 16.</hi> But theſe wiſhes as they are weak and inconſtant, ſo they are inconſiderate. When they hear that holineſs is neceſſary to happineſs, they ſay, <hi>Oh that we might be holy!</hi> But when they underſtand, that holineſs is to hate every pleaſing and gainful ſin to keep unſpotted from the World, and to yield up their whole man unto God that he may dwell and rule in them, and command all, and make what uſe he pleaſes of them in his ſervice to his glory, then their ignorant, and lazy wiſhes to be holy, cool and vaniſh. They are not for preſent and through Sanctification: If they could have grace upon a Death-Bed, juſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep them out of Hell, they look upon that as the beſt time of having it: which ſhews they are of <hi>Balaams</hi> mind, and that they deſire not to live the life, but only <hi>to die the death of the Righteous.</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:95461:58"/> 9. They that have no true grace, <hi>may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a reformation, nay, actually reform in many things.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, when terrified by the voice of the Lord out of the midſt of the Fire, they ſpeak thus to <hi>Moſes, Deut. 5. 27. Go thou near and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it.</hi> Here was a good reſolutin, but when the Lord adds <hi>v. 29. Oh that there were an heart in them to fear me and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them forever!</hi> It ſhews how unlikely 'twas to be kept. Such reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are made in diſtreſs and fear, to ſtop the mouth of a clamorous Conſcience, and in their own ſtrength; and when the diſtreſs is over, they break them as quickly and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as <hi>Sampſons</hi> bands were ſnapt aſunder. And ſuppoſe there be an actual reformation, as in <hi>Herod</hi> who heard <hi>John,</hi> and obſerved him, and <hi>did many things,</hi> Mar. 6. 20. Yet the obedience is but <hi>partial,</hi> there is not a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Lord and his Word <hi>fully. Herod</hi> forſook ſeveral of his iniquities, but his ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous love to <hi>Herodias</hi> his Brother <hi>Philips</hi> Wife, he could not endure to be told of, rather than <hi>pluck out this right eye,</hi> he cuts off the Head of the Baptiſt, who told him 'twas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for him to have her.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95461:59"/> 10. They that have no true grace, <hi>may not only lead an unblameable life, but may ſuffer much upon the account of Religion.</hi> The lives of the Phariſees were free from ſcandalous and notorious Crimes, and yet their righteouſneſs was inſufficient, according to our Lords ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Nay, as external active obedience may be yielded, by them that are graceleſs in heart, ſo ſome paſſive obedience alſo. <hi>Judas</hi> was one of thoſe twelve that forſook all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, but 'tis likely 'twas in hope of a greater gain, for he kept the Bag and bare what was put therein: and probably thought he ſhould be a great man in the Kingdom of Meſſiah, which he deemed a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Unſound ones are acted by vain glory in their ſufferings, not influenced by love to Chriſt and Truth; And though <hi>they give their Bodies to be burned,</hi> and have not this love, what does it profit them? 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 3.</hi> Some may undergo much, but 'tis to promote a Party not Chriſtianity, and though very ſtiff and ſtubborn in their ſufferings, yet much of the expreſs Word of God they caſt behind their backs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They that have no true grace, <hi>may yet be very zealous in defending the Truths of the Goſpel.</hi> I grant Converſion to an Opinion is many times taken and miſtaken for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95461:59"/> unto God, though that Opinion is erroneous; and ſuch Zealots for erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, care to talk of nothing elſe hardly: the moſt warm and ſpiritual diſcourſes are not ſavoury to them, they are apt to judge all that are not of their way, though never ſo holy: but connive at Sin in thoſe that ſide with them, and while their heads are buſie about their Opinions, their ſpirits, hearts and lives are not lookt after. But I go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and affirm, that Graceleſs ones may eſpouſe the quarrel of Truth and ſtand up for the defence of the Goſpel. The Apoſtle tells us of ſome that did preach Chriſt <hi>not ſincerely,</hi> not <hi>of good will,</hi> but <hi>even of envy and ſtrife,</hi> yet he <hi>rejoyced that Chriſt was preached,</hi> and the truth of the Goſpel publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained, <hi>Phil. 1. 15, 16, 18.</hi> Many may ſpeak for that which is really truth, and defend Tenents that are ſound and Orthodox, but theſe Opinions are entertained only as Opinions, they float in their heads but ſink not down into their hearts, neither do they care practically to improve them to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of their actions.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They who have no true grace, may <hi>ariſe ſo high as to have ſome kind of joy:</hi> This joy was in the hearers compared <hi>unto the ſtony ground,</hi> Mat. 13. 20. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers flockt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95461:60"/> to him with rejoycing becauſe of his moſt pleaſant utterance, and taking gifts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God had enriched him: and 'tis very likely that their attendance upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Miniſtery did yield ſome quiet to their Conſciences which elſe would have been very troubleſome, if the Ordinances of God had been wholly neglected. Beſides, the great and glorious things of the Goſpel, may cauſe ſome kind of joy at the hearing of them, as other glad tidings do affect us, eſpecially of ſome good that is poſſible to be obtained. When the love of God in Chriſt is ſet forth, his abundant Grace, the ſureneſs of his Covenant, and the glorious and eternal reſt which remains for his People, the Hearers that are not ſavingly wrought on, may have ſome little <hi>taſte of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the World to come,</hi> as well as be made partakers of the common gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: And all this may cauſe ſome kind of joy. But their joy is without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſorrow for Sin; and though the intereſt of the Fleſh and World prevails, yet this joy remains: the truth is, it has no ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no ſanctifying effect, and will laſt but for a moment.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, ſince the confines of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy extend ſo far, ſince there may be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95461:60"/> ſo much, where there is not ſaving grace: Oh pray that you may not reſt here. Be unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the proving of your ſelves, till you find that you outſtrip all the Hypocrites that ever were. 'Tis neceſſary to exceed them, 'tis not enough to equal them; but Oh how ſad will it be to fall ſhort of thoſe who fall ſhort of the Heavenly Kingdom!</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I proceed unto thoſe <hi>Caſes that relate unto a State of Grace,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of which will be very helpful in the examination and proving of your ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 1.</hi> The firſt Caſe is this; <hi>How ſhall we know when we are ſavingly Enlightned?</hi> Thoſe that are ſaved are made <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> the <hi>eyes of their underſtandings are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and yet there is an illumination which Hypocrites have; How then ſhall ſaving il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination be diſtinguiſhed?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where ſaving illumination is, <hi>the light is marvellous,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>That ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who has called you out of darkneſs into marvellous light.</hi> When God by a word of power ſays, <hi>Let there be light</hi> in a dark mind, that light makes a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſcovery, and the Soul is fill'd with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95461:61"/> wonder, for what was concealed is now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted; and indeed the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does make manifeſt is light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. He that is enlightned ſees his danger, and marvels, that before he ſhould be ſo fearleſs and ſecure. He ſees the vanity and emptineſs of the Creature, and marvels, that he ſhould ſo idolize and dote upon it. He ſees the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleſs of ſin, and marvels, that he ſhould be ſo eager to ſerve it, and love that which is ſo abominable and hateful. He ſees the Lords al-ſufficiency, and marvels, that he could live ſo long without Chriſt and without God in the World, and for ſo doing, calls <hi>himſelf fooliſh and ignorant, and a beaſt before him.</hi> And that the ſcales ſhould at laſt be made to fall off from his eyes, that he might know the things of his peace, this is marvellous kindneſs and grace indeed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saving illumination <hi>humbles. Job</hi> ſays, <hi>Mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job. 42. 5, 6. To know and be proud, is not to know as we ought to know. He that underſtands God and himſelf aright will have high thoughts of God, but he will be low in his own eyes. If we are acquainted with the glorious holineſs and ſpotleſs purity of the Lord, we ſhall be abaſed becauſe of our own
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95461:61"/> pollutions, the diſcovery of his perfections will humble us becauſe of our infirmities. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> upon this diſcovery crys out, he is <hi>a worm,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he is but duſt,</hi> and <hi>Job, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am vile what ſhall I anſwer thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Saving illumination <hi>determines the heart, and prevails with it to come to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 6. 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, and they ſhall be all taught of God, every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> When God does ſhine into the hearts of any, he <hi>gives the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. Chriſt is the Image of the inviſible God, and moſt of God is to be ſeen in Chriſt, here is the moſt glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his abundant Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power and Love; hereupon the Lord Jeſus cannot but be lookt upon as deſirable, and all things are accounted dung and loſs that he may be gained.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Saving illumination <hi>removes prejudices.</hi> Aſſoon as ever the Pſalmiſt came into the Sanctuary, and underſtood the different ends of the righteous and the wicked, his envy at the ungodly their proſperity, and his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt purity and innocency, as if it were in vain, ceaſed, <hi>Pſal. 73.</hi> The carnal
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95461:62"/> mind diſputes as it thinks with ſtrong reaſons before, againſt Religion, but when the Word makes any truely wiſe, preſently, preſently theſe <hi>imaginations are caſt down,</hi> and <hi>the high thoughts againſt the knowledge of God are brought into captivity,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. The Lord of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> that was a great Diſputer againſt God and Chriſt and Godlineſs, when once enlightned, he made this notable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; <hi>That all the ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and abſurdities of the Word of God, fancied by men of corrupt minds and judgments were</hi> now <hi>vaniſhed, and the excellency and beauty of it appeared to him, being come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in the love of it.</hi> Then alſo he cryed out, <hi>That that abſurd and fooliſh Philoſophy which was ſo much admired by ſome, and propagated by</hi> Hobs, <hi>had undone him, and many more of the beſt Parts in the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Saving illumination does <hi>not reſt in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but effectually urges unto practical godlineſs.</hi> They who know the <hi>truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> do <hi>put off concerning the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the old man which is corrupt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deceitful luſts;</hi> They that are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpitit of their mind, do put on that new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4. 21. 24. When the grace of God <hi>does bring Salvation,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95461:62"/> it teaches us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if rightly inſtructed we ſhall obey with a willing mind; for we ſhall ſee plainly, that Sin is the worſt, that God is the beſt Maſter: that Chriſts Yoke is eaſie, his ways pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his paths peace, and at the end there is glory and immortality.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where there is Saving illumination, <hi>there will be a following on to know the Lord,</hi> and a deſire to be enlightned further, and an application unto God himſelf to be the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Miniſters and means are to be made uſe of, but we muſt look beyond both to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the Father of Lights and Mercies. <hi>David</hi> often prays to have his eyes more fully opened, and to be taught to better purpoſe, <hi>Pſal. 119. Moſes</hi> cryes out, Teach us ſo to number our days that we may apply our hearts to Wiſdom, <hi>Pſal. 90. 12.</hi> Who knows not that mans days are few? And yet this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary leſſon, God muſt teach, elſe none will learn it right, ſo as to be indeed the wiſer, and all have need to learn this leſſon more perfectly. The truely enlightned long to be enlightned more, becauſe wiſdom is ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal a thing. <hi>Pſal. 119. 130. The entrance of thy Words giveth light, it giveth underſtanding
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95461:63"/> to the ſimple,</hi> and then preſently it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>verſ. 131. I opened my mouth and panted, for I longed for thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſ 2.</hi> The ſecond Caſe is this; <hi>When may Humiliation be ſaid to be true?</hi> As humiliation in Chriſt went before his exaltation, ſo muſt his followers firſt be humbled in the ſight of the Lord, and he has promiſed to lift them up. Now thus true humiliation may be known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Humiliation implies <hi>a conviction of Sin.</hi> The humbled Soul ſees his Sin, and feels it, ſees the heinouſneſs, feels the weight of it. Thoſe humbled ones, <hi>Eſa. 59. 12.</hi> ſpeak thus, <hi>Our tranſgreſſions are multiplied before, and our iniquities teſtifie againſt us; for our trangreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are with us, and as for our iniquities we know them.</hi> They know their iniquities too well to make light of them, they do indeed know and ſee that <hi>'tis an evil thing and a bitter that they have ſinn'd againſt the Lord,</hi> and were once void of his fear, <hi>Jer. 2. 19.</hi> Being <hi>afflicted, mourning, weeping, turning our laughter to mourning, our joy to heavineſs';</hi> the Apoſtle makes <hi>to be humbling of our ſelves,</hi> Jam. 4. 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True Humiliation implies, <hi>Shame and Self-abhorrency.</hi> Unhumbled <hi>Iſrael</hi> are charged with the want of this. <hi>Jer. 8. 12. Were they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95461:63"/> aſhamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed neither could they bluſh: therefore they ſhall fall among them that fall, in the time that I viſit, they ſhall be caſt down, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But humbled ones <hi>are made to remember their evil ways and their doings that have not been good, ſo as to loath themſelves for their iniquities,</hi> Ezek. 36. 31. They ſee ground for ſhame and bluſhing, conſidering the great guilt that lies upon them, the odious and filthy ſpots and ſtains, that Sin has left upon their Souls: together with the monſtrous ingratitude where with they are chargeable. All their tranſgreſſions have ſtruck at that God who gave them their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, keeps them alive, and out of Hell, and they have not one mercy or comfort but is of his giving. And this God is al-ſeeing, knows the ſecreteſt abominations, is acquainted even with all their heart-impurity: no wonder therefore that they are aſhamed, and lie down and are covered with confuſion, <hi>Jer. 3. 25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. True humiliation implies, <hi>a taking ſhame to our ſelves by confeſſion of Sin,</hi> and as we take ſhame to our ſelves, ſo hereby we <hi>give glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. David</hi> did thus; <hi>Pſ. 51. 3. I acknowledge my iniquity and my ſin is ever before me.</hi> An humbled Sinner, <hi>Eſt fidelis Dei Orator contra ſeipſum,</hi> brings in black Bills of Indictment
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95461:64"/> againſt himſelf, and in his Confeſſion lays o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all, eſpecially the worſt of all: conceals nothing that is evil out of any regard thereto, or unwillingneſs to forſake it. And as <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin ſhall not proſper,</hi> ſo they that thus <hi>confeſs and forſake Sin ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13. Confeſſion is by One called <hi>Vomitus Spiritualis,</hi> a Spiritual Vomiting; they that are indeed humbled, make conſcience of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the iniquities they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: they dare not <hi>return with the Dog to his own vomit again, and with the Swine that is waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. True humiliation implies, <hi>Self-diffidence.</hi> Humbled ones, 'tis very apparent to them that they have no reaſon at all to place any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in themſelves: they ſee that their own wiſdom is folly, and that true wiſdom is from above, they ſee that <hi>their own righteouſneſs is as filthy rags,</hi> Eſa. 64. 6. Therefore they rely not <hi>upon their own righteouſneſs,</hi> but upon the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of Divine <hi>mercy. Dan. 9. 18.</hi> They are ſenſible alſo that their own ſtrength is weakneſs, and here upon that promiſe belongs to them. Eſa. 40. 29. <hi>He giveth power to the ſaint, and to them that have no might he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creafeth ſtrength.</hi> And as the truly humbled Soul dares not truſt in it ſelf, ſo neither does it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95461:64"/> rely upon the creature for help, and though it makes uſe of the means of grace, yet it looks beyond them, truſts not, reſts not in them, but is ſenſible that Ordinances themſelves without the Merit and Spirit of Chriſt, are nothing. The Spirit of Chriſt muſt make them profitable, and the Merit of Chriſt muſt make the engaging in them acceptable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. True Humiliation implies, <hi>a ſubmiſſion unto God:</hi> This is required, <hi>Jam. 4. 6, 7. He reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. Submit your ſelves therefore unto God.</hi> God is taken by humbled Sinners for a Lord, his Will is taken for a Law. <hi>Other Lords have had the dominion over them,</hi> but now they are willing <hi>to make mention of Gods name,</hi> and own his Authority, <hi>Eſa. 26. 13.</hi> They are unwilling that any Sin ſhould have the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Pſal. 119. 133. Order my ſteps in thy Word, and let not any iniquity have the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me.</hi> The Throne of Sin is in the Heart, and the ſtrength of Sin lies in the love of it. They deſire that their very hearts may be cleanſed and that God may dwell and rule there, and their love to Sin, is turned into hatred. And as they ſubmit to the Will and Law of God, ſo they are patient and humble under his mighty hand. They do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Lord for afflicting, but themſelves
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95461:65"/> for deſerving to be afflicted. How ſubmiſſive is the Church, though Gods anger and hand preſſed her ſore. <hi>Mic. 7. 9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord becauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. True Humiliation implies, <hi>a ſenſe of unworthineſs of the leaſt, eſpecially of any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace and mercy.</hi> The humbled prodigal when he came home to his Fathers houſe, what low thoughts he had, you may perceive by the words he is reſolved to ſpeak. <hi>Luk. 15. 18, 19. Father I have ſinn'd againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Father I have not behaved my ſelf like a Son, neither do I expect to be dealt with as a Son, 'twill be great favour to be received as a Servaat, who deſerve to be puniſhed and excluded as an Enemy.</hi> Humbled Sinners do very much conſider their ill deſerts, and how are they filled with admiration at the free grace of God in his Son Jeſus, which is the ground of their hope and encouragement. By the grace of God they are, what they are; they have, what they have; they hope, what they hope for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 3. The third Caſe follows; <hi>How may we be ſure that our deſires after God and grace
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95461:65"/> are ſincere?</hi> 'Tis a Maxim in practical Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>That the deſires after Grace, are Grace,</hi> but they muſt be true deſires. Now theſe may thus be known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sincere deſires <hi>ſpring from knowledge and ſerious conſideration.</hi> The Lord is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an unknown God to them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſire after him: he has cauſed his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is his glory to paſs before them, and the deſirableneſs of that goodneſs has been perceived. <hi>Jer. 24. 7. I will give them an heart to know me:</hi> and then it follows, they <hi>ſhall return to me with their whole heart.</hi> The eyes muſt be anointed with eye-ſalve, the judgment muſt be inlightned and informed concerning the Lords perfections, and fulneſs and riches of grace and mercy, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to communicate of theſe riches: then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him will be real and well-grounded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sincere deſires <hi>are prevailing;</hi> my meaning is, that God and Grace are deſired more than any thing the World, than all the World beſides. An Author tells us, that <hi>Tepidit as eſt parvus amor boni.</hi> Lukewarmneſs implies ſome little love to that which is good, but there is a greater love to that which is evil and vain: And what does the little love then ſignifie? If God be not deſired above all, he is not truely at all deſired. That was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95461:66"/> deſire, <hi>Pſal. 73. 25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> That is, All things comparatively to thee are undeſirable in my eſteem. In the <hi>Roman</hi> State 'twas ſaid;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Nec ferre poteſt Caeſarve priorem,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Pompeiusve parem.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not endure a ſuperior, and <hi>Pompey</hi> could not brook an equal. God will have neither ſuperior nor equal in our hearts, they that love him truely give him the higheſt room of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sincere deſires <hi>bear up againſt oppoſition.</hi> Though the <hi>Fleſh does luſt,</hi> and Mammon and Satan joyn with it, yet <hi>the Spirit does luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. There is a longing to be deliver'd <hi>from the body of Sin,</hi> to be rid of that <hi>evil which is preſent,</hi> when good is about to be done, <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> Where there are deſires after Grace indeed, the remainders of Sin are irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fom; and we ſhall ſigh and wiſh, <hi>that the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus may make us free from the law of Sin and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Sincere deſires <hi>are great enemies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays. Davids</hi> Soul made haſte to God and to do his duty. <hi>Pſal. 119. 60. I made haſte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to keep thy commandments,</hi> and he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95461:66"/> deſires that God would make haſte to him. <hi>Pſal. 101. 2. I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way, Oh when wilt thou come to me!</hi> So Pſal. 70. 1. <hi>Make haſte O God to deliver, make haſte to help me O Lord.</hi> And when God did withdraw from him, he cryes out, <hi>How long wilt thou forget me O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> Pſ. 13. 1. Every day does ſeem a year, and every year does ſeem an age to longing Souls, when the Lord with-holds his quickening and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence from them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sincere deſires are <hi>extended to every thing which God propounds in his Word as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable.</hi> Not ſome onely, but all the benefits of Chriſt are longed after, all his Offices are prized. Sincere ones ſee a neceſſity of Chriſt a Prieſt upon the Croſs, they love to hear him as a Prophet in the Pulpit, and are very deſirous to ſubmit to him as a Prince upon the Throne; Nay, they yield their hearts to be his Throne. The Laws of God are dear to them, they deſire to <hi>keep them all:</hi> to be <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all the fulneſs of God:</hi> to <hi>ſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat in all the will of God:</hi> Nay, they aſpire ſo high, as to beg <hi>that they may do his will on Earth as 'tis done in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 6. 10.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:95461:67"/>6. Sincere deſires <hi>are induſtrious. Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>a deſire of the ſlothful, which kills him becauſe his hands refuſe to labour,</hi> Prov. 21. 25. He periſhes for want of the good deſired, becauſe he will not take pains to obtain it. True deſires are accompanied with a fear of miſſing what is deſired, not ſo as to make unbelieving concluſions, but to quicken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diligence. <hi>Pſal. 27. 4. One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after.</hi> Then we deſire really, when we ſeek diligently. And where is diligence and pains better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, than when ſeeking the Lord, who has told us as certainly <hi>as he is,</hi> ſo certainly he will be <hi>a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sincere deſires <hi>are never quite ſatisfied here in this World.</hi> What is ſaid concerning earthly riches,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Creſcit amor nummi quantum ipſa pecunia creſcit.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q> may be applied to the true riches, <hi>Creſcit amor, quantum divitiae,</hi> love to them, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after more, increaſes as they increaſe. He that has moſt grace is moſt deſirous to have more. 'Tis true indeed, our Lord tells us, <hi>Joh. 6. 35. He that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> But if this be referr'd to Spiritual things, the meaning is, he ſhall not ſo hunger and thirſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95461:67"/> as to deſpair and be tormented with deſpair of ſatisfaction, or elſe the paſſage may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the things of this World, that <hi>impia fames,</hi> that ſinful and eager hunger and thirſt after them ſhall ceaſe. Sincere Souls never can in this World, and they think they never can, prize their Lord Jeſus, love and fear, and ſerve their God ſufficiently, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire ſtill to do all this more and better: they forget the things behind, and are ſtill reaching forward, and if you ask when they will be ſatisfied, <hi>David</hi> ſhall anſwer, <hi>Pſal. 17. ult.</hi> and what he ſpeaks of himſelf is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others; <hi>As for me I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, and be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 4. A fourth Caſe may be this; <hi>How may we be able to diſcern, whether in Religion we are acted meerly by ſlaviſh fear, yea or no?</hi> Though carnal ſecurity is that which ruines the moſt of men, yet a ſlaviſh fear, yea or no? Though carnal ſecurity is that which ruines the moſt of men, yet a ſlaviſh fear is to be found alſo in the ungodly. Such a fear there was in thoſe we read of, <hi>Pſal. 78. 34.</hi> When the hand of the Lord was ſtretched out, and ſlew many of them, the reſt feared, and ſought him: and yet the hearts of theſe who thus out of ſlaviſh fear ſought the Lord were not right with him. This kind of fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the Sinners and Hypocrites. <hi>Eſa. 33. 14.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95461:68"/> The Sinners in</hi> Sion <hi>are afraid; fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites, who among us ſhall dwell with devouring Fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas 22. q. 19. art. 2.</hi> tells us of a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fear: there is a <hi>Timor mundanus,</hi> a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, when for fear of the Worlds frowns and hatred, we turn away from God. There is <hi>Timor ſervilis,</hi> a flaviſh fear, when meerly for fear of puniſhment there is ſome ſeeking unto God. There is <hi>Timor filialis,</hi> a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fear, when we fear offending God, and ſo follow and cleave unto him. Finally there is <hi>Timor initialis,</hi> an initial fear, which is partly a fear of Sin and partly a fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Such a fear was in the trembling. Jaylour at firſt Converſion, who certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited after the way to be ſaved both from ſin and wrath, <hi>Act. 16.</hi> and a mixture of both we read of in the Saints: there is a childlike fear. <hi>Pſal. 112. 1. Bleſſed is every one that feareth the Lord and that delighteth greatly in his Commands;</hi> And there is likewiſe a fear of puniſhment. <hi>Pſal. 119. 120. My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> This <hi>Slaviſh fear</hi> I am diſcourſing of, which is certainly bad, and when alone, only in thoſe that are bad. Now becauſe doubting Souls harp much upon this ſtring, that they are acted meerly by ſlaviſh fear, and 'tis one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95461:68"/> of the difficulteſt doubts to remove, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I ſhall deſcribe more largely thoſe that in Religion are acted by this ſervile fear, that by proving of your ſelves you may know whether you are of the number.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that are acted meerly by Slaviſh fear, <hi>diſlike nothing in Sin but the puniſhment:</hi> Their eyes were never opened to ſee Sin as the Apoſtle lookt upon it, <hi>out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> they never beheld the excellency of righteouſneſs nor the evil of iniquity, but ſtill Sin is as high as ever, in their affections, though fear reſtrain them from the acts of it. 'Tis ſaid of a wicked man, that he <hi>abhorreth not evil,</hi> Pſal. 36. 4. he does not abhor it when he fears to commit it. The Merchant in a Storm loves his Goods, and is ſorry that he is reduced to that ſtrait, that he muſt either throw his Goods overboard or loſe his Life, and after the Tempeſt is at an end, he would be glad if his Goods might be recovered; juſt thus are they affected towards Sin, that are meerly acted by Slaviſh fear. Sin it ſelf is liked, but Affliction, Death, and Hell fright them. They are unconcerned that God by their Sin is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, his goodneſs abuſed, his Law broken, and themſelves enſlaved and defiled and rendred hateful in his eyes, only they are diſmayed at the puniſhment unto which their Sin expoſes them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:95461:69"/>2. They that are acted meerly by Slaviſh fear, <hi>are afraid of coming to the light, which may diſcover their Sin and themſelves more fully to them:</hi> they ſee but too much already, they are unwilling to ſee more. Our Lord ſpeaks generally concerning all evil men, That <hi>they hate the light, neither come to the light leſt their deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> Joh. 3. 20. They that are lovers of ſin muſt needs be alſo lovers of darkneſs, and enemies to plain dealing. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf through fear of puniſhment, and yet cannot endure the faithful reproving Prophet <hi>Micaiah. There is one</hi> Micaiah <hi>but I hate him, for he propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not good concerning me but evil,</hi> 1 King. 22. 8. If thou approveſt of a ſearching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and art willing to have thy ſin and the plague of thy heart made more fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: if thou art willing to hear all that evil which God ſpeaks of thy Sin, in his Word, it argues thy heart is really alienated from it, and there is ſomething more than Slaviſh fear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Slaviſh fear has <hi>but an unconſtant effect:</hi> This fear <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>has torment,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and no wonder if perſons are weary of it, and endeavour to have their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſtupified, that they may have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for ſin paſt, and ſerve it for the future
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95461:69"/> without diſturbance. The will remaining unregenerate and corrupted, muſt needs be really deſirous of a falſe peace, and to have the wound <hi>healed, though it be but ſlightly.</hi> The language therefore of ſuch is, <hi>Propheſy not unto us right things, propheſy unto us ſmooth things, propheſy deceits,</hi> Eſa. 30. 10. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> while the hand of God was upon him, was full of fear, he felt that the Lord Jehovah the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was above his match; and then he ſeems reſolved to comply with the will of God, to let his people go to ſerve him: but the effect of this fear is but unconſtant, though fear thaw'd his heart a little, like the ſhining of the Sun in a winters day, as ſoon as ever <hi>he had reſpite, he hardned his heart again and refuſed to let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go,</hi> Exod. 8. 15. If therefore we are deſirous of a laſting change, and are willing to have our Conſciences more throughly awakened, and more faithfully to perform their Office, 'tis a ſign the will it ſelf begins to be renewed by the ſpecial grace of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Slaviſh fear is accompanied <hi>with hatred of God and of his Law.</hi> The Slave fears his Maſter and hates him, and is ſorry he muſt be ſubject to him. And the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95461:70"/> can it be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. Whilſt any remain car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, they are eſtranged from God, they deſire not any fellowſhip with him, they like not his Yoke, but look upon his <hi>commands as grievous,</hi> and upon <hi>himſelf as an hard and auſtere Maſter,</hi> they are far from eſteeming Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning all things to be right, and wiſhing that their ways were directed to keep his Statutes. Thoſe therefore who like the Law of God, and conſent unto it as good, and bleſs the Lord that he has given them ſuch a Law, and account it their priviledge and liberty that he will vouchſafe to rule them, and are troubled at the reluctancy that is in their Natures againſt the yoke of God, and cry as <hi>Ephraim did; I am as a Bullock unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the Yoke, turn thou me and I ſhall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31. 18. In ſuch there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond ſervile fear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They that are acted meerly by Slaviſh fear <hi>do not deſire to be acted by love.</hi> Sin and the Creature have their love without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they have no longings to <hi>have their hearts directed into the love of God.</hi> That promiſe, <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall circumciſe thy heart to love him with all thy heart and ſoul that thou mayeſt live,</hi> Deut. 30. 6. is not priz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not pleaded. If once therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grudge our luſts, and the world, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95461:70"/> and deſire they may be placed upon things above, Slaviſh fear does not act us, but the Sanctifying Spirit. Slaviſh fear cannot make us deſire to be acted <hi>not</hi> by Slaviſh fear but it muſt needs be ſome other Principle that is put within us. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compares Childlike and Slaviſh fear unto two Women that are married: the one is Chaſte, the other deſires to be an Harlot, but is not one, through fear of her Husbands anger. The chaſte one fears her Husbands diſpleaſure, but loves his company; the wanton one fears her Husbands diſpleaſure, but wiſhes his abſence. Now ſuppoſe this wanton Wife ſhould begin to grudge her heart to others, and ſhould deſire to love and delight in her Husband, ſhe would then be no longer acted by a Slaviſh fear, but it would argue, her mind changed, and that there were ſome beginning of conjugal affection, and ſenſe of her duty. A deſire to love the Lord above all, can never be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of meer fear, but manifeſts a ſenſe that he is indeed moſt deſirable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They that are acted meerly by Slaviſh fear, <hi>though they are affrighted at the thoughts of Hell, yet Spiritual things are not ſuitable to them,</hi> they do not <hi>mind</hi> and ſavour <hi>the things of the Spirit,</hi> but only <hi>the things of the Fleſh,</hi> which ſhews an unchanged heart though there
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95461:71"/> be an awakened Conſcience. The heart of ſuch is all for the earth and carthly things, and theſe things are really preferr'd before grace and glory: The World unto ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed ones is lookt upon as a better and more proper portion, than God himſelf. If therefore the World is become low in our eſteem, and the vanity of it evident, and we had rather have the Lord to be our God and Father and portion, than to have the greateſt abundance of earthly enjoyments without him: this ſpeaks a real love and not a ſervile fear only, 'tis a good ſign when the greateſt outward felicity and proſperity is judged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that <hi>happineſs of having the Lord to be our God,</hi> Pſal. 144. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. They that are acted meerly by Slaviſh fear, <hi>are not jealous of themſelves and afraid leſt they ſhould be acted by nothing elſe.</hi> This very concernedneſs and godly jealouſie argues gracious deſires and principles. In a word, Slaviſh fear will never carry us ſo far as to make us conſent unto a true and laſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God. <hi>Falſe motives can never make us deſire to be truly ſincere and upright Chriſtians, and to be acted only by motives that are right.</hi> If therefore in Religion, we are willing that our Principles ſhould be pure and good, our ends right, and our actions and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95461:71"/> manner of doing them according to the will of God, it may ſerve to ſatisfie us that we are of <hi>Davids</hi> mind, who prayed, (and ſuch a prayer never meets with a deaf ear) <hi>Pſal. 119. 80. Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes that I be not aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 5.</hi> The fifth Caſe is this; <hi>How may we know that we have indeed accepted Chriſt?</hi> He is offered unto all, received by few. He ſtands at the door and knocks, but few hear his voice and open the door to him. We may call our ſelves by his Name, and profeſs to be his, and receive his Ordinances and engage in them, and yet not receive himſelf: and yet this Reception muſt be, elſe there can be no Reconciliation, no Adoption, no Salvation. Thus therefore we may prove our ſelves and know whether we have indeed received Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we have ſeen ſo as to be affected with our need of him.</hi> The prodigal was ready to periſh in the far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, neceſſity drove him home to his Fathers houſe. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs were ſtung and ready to die by the fiery Serpents, and then they lookt up unto the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for cure. We ſhall never upon right terms receive our Lord and Saviour, till we perceive we are loſt and ruin'd and muſt needs be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly miſerable without him. Oh then we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95461:72"/> ſhall ſubſcribe to any Articles of agreement, that Jeſus may be ours, who can <hi>juſtifie us by his blood, and deliver us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we have been made dead to the Law.</hi> Rom. 7. 4. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren ye are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another: even to him that is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> So <hi>Gal. 2. 19. I am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> You muſt not imagine by deadneſs to the Law, is meant ſuch a diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from it, that we have no tie upon us to obey it; for the Apoſtle hear ſpeaks of living unto God, and bringing forth fruit to him: Now living unto God, and bringing forth the fruits of righteouſneſs is what the law requires. Then therefore we are dead to the Law, when we are not irritated and provoked to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, becauſe the Law forbids tranſgreſſion: and when we expect no juſtification before God by our obedience to the Law. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. <hi>There is not any Law given which can give life to the Sinner:</hi> for <hi>then righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and juſtification <hi>ſhould have been by the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 21. Thoſe therefore that receive Chriſt receive him, as <hi>The Lord their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and dare not expect juſtification before
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95461:72"/> God upon the account of any obedience or righteouſneſs of their own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Croſs:</hi> we ſhall rely upon Chriſt crucified being perſuaded that the blood ſhed upon the Croſs for Sin, was the blood of him that was truely God as well as man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſufficient to make an atonement for us, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs, <hi>1 Joh. 1. 7.</hi> We ſhall alſo conform to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of Chriſt, by <hi>crucifying the Fleſh with the affections and luſts of it,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. The <hi>World</hi> alſo will be crucified to us, <hi>Gal. 6. 14.</hi> Sin has laid it under a Curſe, and we ſhall look upon the World, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did on Chriſt when they crucified him, <hi>as having no form, nor comlineſs,</hi> no ſuch beauty in it, that we ſhould ſo eagerly deſire it. Finally we ſhall be willing to <hi>take up the Croſs, and deny our ſelves,</hi> and ſuffer perſecution, and go through any tribulation which lies in our way to the Kingdom of Heaven. They that are offended at perſecution, and in ſuch <hi>times of temptation fall away,</hi> never received Chriſt or his Word into their hearts indeed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we have accepted Chriſt, we <hi>ſubmit unto his Scepter, entertain his Word and are willing to obey him.</hi> God hath <hi>exalted him to be a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> and Believers muſt gladly conſent that this Saviour, ſhould be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95461:73"/> exalted into the throne of their hearts and rule as Prince there. They who will not have this Lord to reign over them are Enemies, and ſhall be dealt with and deſtroyed as Enemies at laſt. But he is <hi>the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. Whom he ſaves, he makes by his power willing and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. 'Twas ſaid unto the Lord, Meſſiah; <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110. 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we are born again and made new Creatures. 2 Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature.</hi> And <hi>Joh. 1. 12, 13.</hi> They that receive and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, are ſaid to <hi>be born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Grace does not come by natural deſcent: the fleſh has no will or deſire after it, man though never ſo eminent is not able to work it, but 'tis alone from God. And all true Believers are born of God, they have a new heart, a new nature, new deſires and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new deſigns are carried on, and they walk in newneſs of life. The old man indeed remains in part, but they are burthen'd with it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more fully to put on the new, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we do, and we ſee cauſe, to admire the Fathers love in ſending
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95461:73"/> him:</hi> we look upon him as the greateſt gift that ever was given or could be given to the ſons of men. He <hi>is all in all,</hi> Col. 3. 11. He <hi>fills all in all,</hi> Eph. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> If Chriſt be ours God is ours, Heaven is ours, all is ours. Here's a height that none can reach, a depth that none can fathom, a length that none can mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a bredth that none can comprehend. How do Believers admire Jeſus and the love of the Father that gave him. They know <hi>that gift of God,</hi> and wonder at the Donors kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 9, 10. In this, i. e.</hi> in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, <hi>was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World that we might live through him.</hi> If ye talk of love <hi>herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. If we have accepted Chriſt, <hi>we live upon him by faith,</hi> we are ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>I live,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. And thus relying upon the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace and ſtrength of our Lord Jeſus, which is made perfect in our weakneſs, we ſhall reſolve to follow the Lamb without ſtanding ſtill, without turning aſide, without drawing back from him, we ſhall not coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95461:74"/> fly, nor treacherouſly revolt from him, <hi>but follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 6.</hi> The ſixth Caſe is this; <hi>When may Converſion be judged to be ſincere and true?</hi> Man is departed from the Lord, and he is brought to this ſtrait, either he muſt turn to God, or he muſt burn in Hell, and every turning will not ſerve our turn. The Scripture ſpeaks of a <hi>feigned Converſion,</hi> ſuch a Convert was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Judah,</hi> Jer. 3. 10. It concerns us to prove our ſelves, whether we are Converts in reality: which may be thus known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sincere Converts have been made to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their own ways, and the evil and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs of them. David</hi> tells us, <hi>he thought on his ways and turned,</hi> Pſal. 119. 59. They have lookt to the end of the broad road in which they once went, and ſeen that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lake at the end of it: deſtruction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is in that way, and ſo they dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. He never turns from Sin indeed that ſees no harm or danger in it. Thoſe Scriptures, <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall die,</hi> and <hi>The wages of Sin is death,</hi> are deeply engraven upon the Converts heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sincere Converts are <hi>really grieved that they turn'd no ſooner,</hi> they reflect with ſorrow
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95461:74"/> and ſhame upon that time, <hi>wherein they were fooliſh and diſobedient and deceived, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved diverſe luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. and wiſh they had been ſo wiſe as to have ſerved another, a better Maſter. How are they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted that Sin and Satan and Mammon, have ſtolen away ſo many of their few days, and that their luſts ſhould devour the cream and prime of all their time. They think with themſelves, how much Sin might have been prevented, how much Grace might have been gotten, how much might have been done for God, if they had turned ſooner: and this makes them to live the <hi>remainder of their time in the fleſh, not to the luſts of men, but to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sincere Converts <hi>turn unto God himſelf,</hi> they own him as a Lord, and eye him as their happineſs in their Converſion to him. <hi>Jer. 4. 1. If thou wilt return, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto Me.</hi> They ſeek the Lord himſelf, and his ſtrength and his face evermore; the mercies of God indeed they do and may deſire: but principally the Father of them, they ſee that God has all, is all, and can be infinitely more than all things unto them, they come to him that they may enjoy him here and for ever. <hi>Lord, be my God, my Father, my Inheritance, give thy ſelf to me, and then thou wilt deal
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95461:75"/> moſt bountifully with me!</hi> That's the Converts language.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sincere Converts <hi>turn with their whole heart.</hi> This is called for, <hi>Joel. 2. 12. Turn ye even unto me with all your heart:</hi> And the want of this is complain'd of, <hi>Jer. 3. 10. Her treacherous Siſter</hi> Judah <hi>hath not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi> When the whole heart is turned, no iniquity is regarded there, but all is diſliked; no creature is ſuffered to have the higheſt room, the whole heart is reſigned and given unto God. As the Beſieged render up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Conquerer, that he may diſpoſe of it as he pleaſes, ſo the Convert renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: all the powers and faculties of his Soul he yields, and conſents to have all renewed, all ſanctified, which is a perfection of parts, and a perfection of degrees is deſired and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired unto: he longs to be turned more and more, and to be kept from returning again to folly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sincere Converts <hi>turn their feet unto Gods teſtimonies.</hi> Pſal. 119. 59. <hi>I turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies:</hi> They conform to the Word which God has ſpoken as their Rule. This declares beſt of all, <hi>Quid pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</hi> what is fair and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95461:75"/> what is filthy, what is profitable and what's deſtructive. By this Word they order their hearts and converſations. He that deſpiſes the Word of God and the Commands of it, is not ſincerely converted, but damnably deluded. True Converts keep cloſe to Scriptures and Ordinances, and never fancy themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them: but with <hi>David, deſire to dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the days of their lives,</hi> (for in his Houſe Ordinances are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred) <hi>that they may behold the beauty of the Lord and enquire in his Temple,</hi> Pſ. 27. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 7.</hi> The ſeventh Caſe follows; <hi>What are the lower degrees of true Grace?</hi> Grace in Scripture being compared to a <hi>grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed,</hi> which is <hi>indeed the leaſt of all ſeeds</hi> that are ſown in the field, <hi>Mat. 13. 31, 32.</hi> Hereby there is an intimation given us, that Grace is but little in the firſt beginnings of it, and becauſe ſmall, 'tis not ſo eaſie to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Yet the leaſt meaſure of true Grace being of far greater value and more precious than Gold that periſhes, 'tis worth our while to bring it to the Touchſtone that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and known. Before I reſolve the Caſe, wherein I muſt be very wary, leſt the unſound preſume, and leſt the ſincere be diſcouraged: I ſhall premiſe theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. True Grace has <hi>different degrees, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95461:76"/> the higher and lower degrees are vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from each other;</hi> Such a difference as there is between a <hi>grain</hi> of Muſtard-ſeed, and <hi>the Plant grown up ſo that the Birds of the air may lodge in the branches of it;</hi> Such a difference as there is between a new born infant, and a man grown: truely ſuch a difference there is between weak and ſtrong Grace; and yet as the infant has all the parts which the man hath, and is of the ſame kind with him: ſo weak grace and ſtrong grace are of the ſame kind: and the weak is true and ſaving as well as the ſtrong. That there is a difference in the degrees of Grace is evident. Some are <hi>babes,</hi> and ſome are <hi>ſtrong men,</hi> Heb. 5. 13, 14. Some are ſtyled <hi>little children,</hi> ſome <hi>young men,</hi> and ſome are called <hi>Fathers,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True Grace is conſiſtent <hi>with little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the things of God.</hi> There may be a great meaſure of notional knowledge, where there is no true Grace at all; and there may be true Grace, where there is a great weakneſs as to underſtanding. The Diſciples when firſt they were choſen out of the World and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Spirit, underſtood but little of the Goſpel: <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf would have <hi>diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſt from dying,</hi> not knowing that his blood was to be the price of the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Mat. 16. 21, 22.</hi> The very Apoſtles themſelves wondred what the <hi>Reſurrection of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95461:76"/> Chriſt from the dead ſhould mean.</hi> Surely they had not then much light, and yet they had true Grace. And though theſe and ſuch like great Articles of the Chriſtian Faith are more fully revealed, ſo that 'tis neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know them: yet in ſome heads the knowledge is but little, where yet the heart is truly turned unto God, and prizes Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where there is true Grace, <hi>there may be many doubts and fears.</hi> Our Lord ſays unto <hi>Peter: O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> Mat. 14. 31. And unto all his Diſciples he ſpeaks thus; <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi> Mat. 8. 26. Faith they had, and yet 'twas little, and this faith is own'd, though accompanied with doubts and fears. Doubting believers for ought I know are the far <hi>major</hi> part of them. Sincere Souls are prone to be jealous of themſelves, and they apprehend how much it ſtands them upon to make ſure work for Eternity. Hereupon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and the remainders of unbelief take the advantage, and they are ſtill queſtioning their ſtate, and are full of fears that nothing is wrought in them, but what is common unto Hypocrites.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where there is true Grace, <hi>there may be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95461:77"/> much corruption.</hi> I grant that Grace reigns wherever it is in truth, and yet much Sin may remain though it be an underling: thus the Oyl is at the top of the Veſſel, though the Water which is under it be a far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. Grace is compared unto <hi>ſmoaking Flax:</hi> now in the ſmoaking Flax there's much of ſtench and cloudineſs and but little heat; and yet this heat is taken notice of, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, and the promiſe is; <hi>Mat. 12. 20. A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking Flax ſhall he not quench till he ſend forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe that have true Grace, <hi>may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sins that are foul and ſcandalous,</hi> and by ſuch falls they break their bones, diſturb their peace, and wound their Conſciences, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves exceedingly, ſo that they are the apter to ſtumble and fall again upon the next temptation. When notorious Sins are thus committed by Believers, Grace is at a very low ebb, and yet <hi>the living Water</hi> which ſprings up to everlaſting life, (ſo Grace is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) is not quite dried up. It is ſtrange, yet not ſo ſtrange as true, that <hi>righteous</hi> Lot <hi>who vexed his ſoul from day to day becauſe of the</hi> Sodomites <hi>unlawful deeds,</hi> ſhould give way to drunkenneſs firſt; though 'tis not ſo ſtrange that he ſhould commit inceſt afterwards, for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95461:77"/> he that is drunken knows not what he does. Though he was delivered out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet he carried but too much of <hi>Sodom</hi> within him in his heart. <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart, yet in his heart there did kindle an impure and helliſh flame of luſt whereby <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was ſcorched and hurt as well as himſelf, and which was the occaſion of the death of poor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah.</hi> Now though <hi>David</hi>'s joy was quite gone, yet the Sanctifying Spirit was not clean departed, though his operation was for a while ſuſpended: therefore he prays for the <hi>reſtoring of joy,</hi> but that the <hi>holy Spirit might not be taken away,</hi> Pſal. 51. 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thoſe that have true Grace <hi>may ſend forth ſuch ſad complaints as ſpeak a nearneſs to deſpair. Job</hi> cryes out, <hi>The arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are within me, the poyſon whereof drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up my Spirit, the terrors of God do ſet themſelves in aray againſt me,</hi> Job. 6. 4. The Church complains, Lam. 3. <hi>God hath ſet, me in dark place as thoſe that have been dead of old: he hath hedged me about that I cannot get out, and made my chain heavy: he hath filled me with bitterneſs and made me drunken with Wormwood; alſo when I cry and ſhout he ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out my prayer.</hi> This was worſt of all to be in a deplorable caſe, and not to be regarded when crying for relief and pitty. Eminent
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95461:78"/> Saints have ſometimes concluded themſelves forſaken and forgotten: no wonder if they that have weak Grace, confidently affirm they have none at all, and as peremptorily conclude they never ſhall have any.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I am to tell you which are the lower degrees of true grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>ſenſe and wearineſs of hardneſs of heart,</hi> argues ſome meaſure of true Grace: it ſhews ſome life and ſoftneſs when deadneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is felt as a burthen. Though hardneſs of heart was incomparably the worſt of all the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet <hi>this, Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were never ſenſible of, nor deſirous to be delivered from it, though other plagues they cry to have removed. That's true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when the heart is grieved, it is ſo hard, and can ſorrow no more for Sin: Such an heart will carefully ſhun whatever has an hardning effect; and oh, how is that promiſe prized, and the accompliſhment of it longed for, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart will I give you and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the heart of ſtone out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> And when once Sinners are ſenſible ſo as to <hi>inquire</hi> and ſeek unto the God of <hi>Iſrael to do this for them,</hi> here is a good work begun in them. I grant
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95461:78"/> ſuch may fear ſometimes they are judicially hardned, but that very fear plainly ſhews the contrary; if they were under ſuch a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would ceaſe to be afraid of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It argues a beginning of a work of Grace, when a Sinner <hi>is troubled to ſee ſuch an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in his corrupted nature againſt God, and deſires to be turned indeed;</hi> Thus <hi>Ephraim bemoans himſelf, that he was as a Bullock unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the Yoke,</hi> and he cryes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and that God would ſhew his power and grace in <hi>the turning of him,</hi> Jer. 31. 18. and <hi>verſ. 20.</hi> we find the Lord owns <hi>Ephraim as his dear Son, as a pleaſant Child,</hi> and ſays, <hi>he does earneſtly remember him, and will ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> It argues a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when we are weary of the old, and that the bent and inclination of the heart is really changed: when backwardneſs unto what is good begins to be burthenſom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a work of Grace, <hi>where there is a reſolution to go unto God and confeſs all Sin unto him without hiding any through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep it.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> thus <hi>without guile</hi> does reſolve upon Confeſſion, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon Remiſſion, and forgives him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. <hi>Pſal. 32. 5. I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and my iniquity have I not hid, I ſaid I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95461:79"/> will confeſs my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin</hi> Selah. Hark what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>He that covereth his Sins ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks a great word; <hi>1 Joh. 1. 9. If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> O thou ſenſible and droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trembling Soul, who comeſt unto God with black Bills of Indictment againſt thy ſelf! Is all thy wickedneſs down there that thou knoweſt? Haſt thou not left out one or other that is a darling? <hi>Oh no here are all down, and the darling ſins in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner acknowledged and aggravated, and I am willing to forſake all, as well as to have the pardon of all.</hi> If it be ſo chear up; for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and be ſaved,</hi> is the Goſpel language. When <hi>David ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> Nathan <hi>anſwers, The Lord hath put away thy Sin thou ſhalt not die,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a work of grace, where there is <hi>a deſire to believe.</hi> He that ſearcheth the heart takes notice of the deſires which are there; and as a deſire to kill is Murther, as a luſting after a Woman is Adultery, ſo a deſire after that which is good is accepted. A deſire to repent is repenting, and a deſire
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95461:79"/> to believe is believing. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again to <hi>have offered up</hi> Iſaac, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had a will to do it at Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though actually he never did it, <hi>Heb. 11. 17.</hi> which ſhews the truth of that paſſage of <hi>Auguſtine, Coronat Deus intus bonam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem ubi non invenit facultatem.</hi> Where there is a defect of ability, God does own and crown a real willingneſs. Such deſires muſt needs be very pleaſing unto God, who willeth that his grace ſhould be earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and therefore ſays the ſame Father, <hi>Deſiderare auxilium gratiae, eſt initium gratiae.</hi> Grace is begun, when Grace is deſired. When once a Sinner deſires with his heart to believe, and cries out with the man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord help my unbelief,</hi> Mar. 9. 24. When he deſires that his heart may be ſet wide open, that Chriſt who knocks there may enter in; when he deſires to receive Chriſt, juſt ſo as Chriſt is willing to be received, and to rely upon him as the onely Mediatour and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, renouncing all other Confidences. Here is ſaving faith moſt certainly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a work of Grace, where there is <hi>a wearineſs of other Lords, and a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſubmit unto Chriſt the Lord of Glory.</hi> 'Tis a good ſign when there is a conſent to caſt off the yoke of Sin, and to take on us
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95461:80"/> the eaſie yoke of Chriſt: for none but they that are truely gracious are willing to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of darkneſs, and to be tranſlated into the Kingdom of the Son of God, Col. 1. 13.</hi> If we diſlike the <hi>bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and are unwilling to be <hi>led captive by Satan at his will;</hi> if we look upon our ſelves as <hi>fooliſh and deceived,</hi> while <hi>we were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and ſerved diverſe luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. If we count the Service of our Lord Jeſus freedom, and freedom indeed: and <hi>luſt againſt the Fleſh</hi> which counts his Commands grievous; certainly the Spirit of the Lord has begun to ſet us at liberty, our eyes have been opened, our hearts changed, <hi>Voluntas non eſſet libera, niſi liberata.</hi> The will would not be thus free to be ſubject unto Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it had been made free by Him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is a work of Grace, where there is <hi>a deſire to fear the name of God.</hi> Neh. 1. 11. <hi>Let thine ear be attentive,</hi> and ſo it was, <hi>unto the prayer of thy Servants who deſire to fear thy Name.</hi> That Soul is renewed that would fain ſtand in awe of God, and of his Word, and has a will to do good, though evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the Fleſh is weak. The weakneſs of the Fleſh, Chriſt excuſes, as long as he ſaw <hi>the Spirit of the Diſciples was willing</hi> to have done their duty, <hi>Mat. 26. 41.</hi> That which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95461:80"/> was Gods wiſh concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, is it thy wiſh concerning thy ſelf? <hi>Oh that there were an heart in me to fear the Lord, and to keep all his Commandments always, that it may be well with me for ever?</hi> Deut. 5. 29. This is certainly the breathing of the new creature. In ſuch there is a conſent to be the Lords, and to ſerve him, and a trouble when they are overpowr'd by ſin and temptation, and a jealouſie leſt they ſhould be deceived; which ſhews that their deſire to fear and obey the Lord is the more honeſt and ſincere.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is a work of Grace, where there <hi>is an uncontentedneſs without God:</hi> before, the Sinner <hi>was without Chriſt, and liv'd without God in the World,</hi> as he thought well enough, <hi>Eph. 2. 12.</hi> but the heart being ſavingly changed cannot be put off with the World, or any thing therein for its portion; as the Needle being toucht by the Loadſtone never ceaſes trembling, till 'tis turned towards the Northern Pole: ſo the heart of one that has grace cannot be quieted or ſatisfied without the God of Heaven. <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory, <hi>l. 36. c. 4.</hi> tells us, that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, which is a Stone of far greater value, being put near the Loadſtone, <hi>ferrum non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur abſtrahi,</hi> does not ſuffer the Loadſtone to draw the Iron to it. The World will loſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95461:81"/> its magnetick and drawing vertue, when once the Lord has toucht the heart, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf. Gracious Souls had rather have God theirs, than all the World theirs: they ſee the Creatures unſuitableneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and that their Souls do then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto their reſt when they return unto their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 8.</hi> The eight Caſe follows, which is this; <hi>How may Grace be diſcovered under Spiritual Deſertion?</hi> Although the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quite leaves his people, yet he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the ſenſe of his Preſence, ſuſpending the quickening and comforting influences of his Spirit: and then they that before were like <hi>Eden</hi> or <hi>Sharon,</hi> are become like unto the Deſart, before, they reſembled a Tree whoſe leaves are fair, and the fruit plentiful and good; But under deſertion, they are like a Tree in the Winter ſeaſon, the Sun being withdrawn, when neither Fruit nor Leaves appear. Now, how ſhall the Saints be known to be Children of Light, when they thus walk in darkneſs? I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Saints under Deſertion <hi>are troubled at Gods abſence.</hi> What perplexity was there in the Spouſes Spirit, when her Beloved had withdrawn himſelf? <hi>Cant. 5. 6. I opened to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95461:81"/> my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himſelf and was gone; my Soul failed when he ſpake, I ſought him but I could not find him, I called him, but he gave me no anſwer.</hi> 'Tis as real a ſign of true love to mourn at the Lords abſence, as to rejoyce in his preſence; for they who grieve when he withdraws, will be glad when he returns. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face,</hi> ſays <hi>David, and I was troubled,</hi> Pſal. 30. 7. God may hide his face from a true Believer, but a Believer ſhews himſelf to be ſo, by being troubled when God hides his face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saints under Deſertion <hi>juſtifie the Lord in deſerting of them,</hi> though holy <hi>Job</hi> ſtands ſtiffly in the vindication of his Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt his Friends who charged him with Hypocriſie; yet withal he conſeſſes his Sins unto God. <hi>Job 7. 20. I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> And <hi>chap. 13. 26. Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my youth.</hi> Deſerted Saints dare not charge God fooliſhly, but lay the blame of what they endure at their own door; they have been proud of enlargements, therefore God has juſtly left them to be ſtraitned; they were unthankful for comforts, therefore juſt it is their ſorrows ſhould return; they were not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95461:82"/> ſo watchful againſt Sin; 'twas righteous in God to hide his face, nay, they confeſs, he would be righteous, if he ſhould be favourable no more, but caſt them off for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Saints under Deſertion <hi>endeavour to find out the cauſe of Gods deſerting them, that it may be removed.</hi> Hark what <hi>Job</hi> prays for; <hi>Job 13. 23, 24. Make me to know my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and my ſin, wherefore hideſt thou thy face and counteſt me for thy enemy?</hi> As the Seamen were willing that failed with <hi>Jonah,</hi> to know for whoſe ſake the Tempeſt was ſo furious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was deſirous to find out the man that had taken of the accurſed thing, and proved the troubler of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So Deſerted Souls cry unto God to diſcover what has offended him, and grieved his holy Spirit; And as <hi>Jonah</hi> that raiſed the Tempeſt was thrown overboard, as <hi>Achan</hi> that troubled <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſtoned unto death, ſo having found out their Sins, that have diſturbed their peace, and provoked their God, they conſent to have them throughly mortified: that which <hi>is meet</hi> they ſay unto God, <hi>I have born thy diſpleaſure, I will not offend any more, that which I ſee not, teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will do no more,</hi> Job 34. 31, 32.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Saints under Deſertion, <hi>though the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95461:82"/> of faith may not, yet fear is more evident in them.</hi> Eſa. 50. 10. <hi>Who is among you that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light.</hi> Deſerted Believers though they cannot with confidence call God their Father, which is their trouble, yet they are reſolved to obey him as their Lord: when he ſeems to fly from them, they are afraid of loſing him, therefore they lament and follow after him. No wonder that Gods withdrawing raiſes fear in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for ordinarily Deſertion, ſpeaks Divine diſpleaſure, and is ſo very ſore a trial and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that the continuance of it may very well be feared.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Saints under Deſertion, are <hi>troubled for want of quickening as well as want of comfort:</hi> therefore they cry for the return of the Spirit that he may revive their graces, and make them lively and vigorous, and active in the Service of God, as well as reſtore peace and conſolation. Deadneſs certainly was <hi>Davids</hi> burthen, when he prayed ſo often that the Lord would quicken him. Deſerted Saints do feel the prevalency of the body of death, therefore they do look, and they have reaſon to look unto Him, <hi>who came that we might have life, and that we might have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> Joh. 10. 10.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:95461:83"/>6. Saints under Deſertion <hi>are unſatisfied till God return,</hi> that's their language; <hi>Pſal. 90. 13, 14. Return, O Lord how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy Servants: O ſatisfie us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoyce and be glad all our days.</hi> Their life lies in his favour, weeping continues while his face is hid: when their God comes, their joy comes to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And as they are deſirous that God ſhould turn to them, ſo alſo that themſelves may be healed and turned unto God. The Church had revolted, and God was angry; angry not only <hi>at their Sins,</hi> but alſo <hi>at their prayers;</hi> in this ſad caſe, the Church is earneſt for her own recovery and return to God, as well as for the ſhining of Gods face upon her: therefore ſhe cries once, twice, thrice, <hi>Turn us again, O Lord God of Hoſts, cauſe thy face to ſhine and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Pſal. 80. 3, 7, 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe 9.</hi> The ninth Caſe is this; <hi>How Grace may be diſcerned under the prevalency of that ſad and black diſtemper of Melancholy.</hi> The tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this malady ſtrangers to it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but they that are afflicted with it do know their own bitterneſs. And the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which Satan hath hereby is unconceivab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great. 'Tis ordinary for him to repreſent the Lord unto Melancholick ones, as furious and revenging and implacable, and irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95461:83"/> as hating them from everlaſting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting. Oh whath diſmal thoughts have they of themſelves! The darkneſs and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their heads, they call judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the deadneſs of their hearts, they call judicial hardneſs; and when the black vapours aſcend, and ſeize upon their ſpirits, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affright them, as if Nature were juſt ready to be diſſolved: this they are apt to think the helliſh agonies of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and to conclude them the foretaſtes and certain forerunners of eternal Wrath and Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Satan repreſents the grace they have, as <hi>no grace,</hi> that he may diſcourage them from duty, if he does not perſuade them to act deſperately againſt their own lives. Then a thought comes in, that God is an hard Lord, who will not give grace, though they deſire it above all the World, but is reſolved to deſtroy them. Again Satan repreſents the Truth they have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and which the generality of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous do embrace, as <hi>no truth:</hi> and violently hurries them, and bears it in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits, <hi>(eſpecially in duty to diſtract and dead their hearts)</hi> that they ought to turn to this or that or t'other erroneous way, elſe they will never know peace. Whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and encouragements the Goſpel hands forth to them, they with a ſtrange obſtinacy reject as too good for them, and not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95461:84"/> at all to them. And though the hand and hatred of Satan be in all this, yet he is ſo ſubtle as to hide himſelf under the dark ſhades of Melancholy, ſo that he is unperceived. Now for the relief of ſuch, I ſhall ſhew how the truth of Grace may be diſcerned under the prevalency of Melancholy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Melancholick ones that are gracious have uſually <hi>very low thoughts of themſelves:</hi> they have not confidence in the fleſh, but are convinced, that their own righteouſneſs is rags, their wiſdom folly, their ſtrength weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they ſee that no fleſh has reaſon to glory in the Lords preſence, and being thus humble, God has promiſed to have reſpect to them. <hi>Pſal. 138. 6. Though the Lord be high, yet hath he reſpect unto the lowly;</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 10. 17. Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart:</hi> an heart prepared to pray they deſire, <hi>thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Melancholick ones, who have grace, though they are full of fears, yet <hi>their fears are without Scripture ground,</hi> they are apt to conclude themſelves Hypocrites, but not from Scripture premiſes. Satan in a violent way does inject ſuch thoughts, that <hi>God hates them, never was indeed near them, or has quite
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95461:84"/> left them, and never any Saints were in the like condition,</hi> and hereupon follows <hi>a ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perplexity,</hi> but not one word of God is produced to prove all this. Though Satans injections are direful and doleful, yet the Word ſpeaks hopefully concerning them, becauſe they are weary of Sin, willing to cloſe with Chriſt, and hunger after righteouſneſs and true holineſs, and had rather have an aſſurance of the love of God, and <hi>the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> than <hi>Corn and Wine,</hi> and all the things of the World in the greateſt plenty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Melancholick ones, who have grace, though they are filled with a great many fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and fears, yet <hi>the fear of God is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and they are afraid of Sin as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil.</hi> The favour of God is moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, his anger moſt formidable in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem: therefore they dare not uſe ſinful or ſuſpected means for their relief and help. They are not like <hi>Saul,</hi> who in his diſtreſs and ſadneſs ran to the <hi>Witch of Endor:</hi> they dare not turn Gluttons and Drunkards, nor attempt to drown their ſorrows in ſenſuality, but had rather remain Melancholick Saints, than become boon Companions and jolly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They do indeed imagine and fear a thouſand things without reaſon; but truely
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95461:85"/> with a great deal of reaſon, the fear of God rules in their hearts, and they eſchew what is evil in his ſight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Melancholick ones, who have grace, <hi>endeavour to improve their melancholy after a gracious manner.</hi> Now the World appears vain, Creatures are miſerable comforters; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights have loſt their reliſh, and are become undelightful; They take hold of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to get more looſe from the World, and more above it. If one <hi>perplexing fume</hi> turns all the World into an empty bubble, into an inſignificant cypher; Why, ſays the gracious Soul, ſhould I ever dote upon this World more? Under Melancholy, Death ſeems very near: and as they are going to bed, or at other times, they have very ſtrong and ſtartling impreſſions of Eternity: Gracious Souls take hold of this advantage the more ſeriouſly to prepare for Death, and to provide for Eternity, and this argues they are indeed the Children of Wiſdom, <hi>Pſal. 90. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Melancholick ones, who have grace, <hi>have a great care of the Goſpels credit:</hi> nay, truely ſometimes this lies nearer their hearts, than their own lives. They are afraid of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frenzy, leſt Religion which they are profeſſors of, ſhould ſuffer by it: they reſiſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95461:85"/> temptations to ſelf-Murther, becauſe if they who have heard and talkt ſo much of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould lay violent hands upon themſelves, prophane Sinners would ſpeak evil of the way of Truth, and be more ſtrongly prejudiced and hardned againſt the Goſpel, as a Doctrine that has but a bad tendency: this ſhews that they love the Goſpel in truth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>are of God,</hi> Joh. 8. 47. This care of the Goſpel farther appears, in that when their melancholy abates, their ſeriouſneſs remains. Indeed the better their heads are, their hearts are in a better frame; becauſe then their Souls and their Grace can act with greater freedom. They long for clean hearts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire clear heads, that with heads and hearts they may be more ſerviceable unto God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Melancholick ones, who have grace, <hi>in all their diſtreſs and trouble deſire to look unto God;</hi> though they fear he is an enemy, yet they cannot but look to him for help; though they do but chatter as a Crane, and mourn as a Dove, yet they cannot refrain ſpeaking <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi> and <hi>Jobs</hi> language: <hi>O Lord I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, undertake for me,</hi> Eſa. 38. 14. I am <hi>full of confuſion, ſee thou my affliction,</hi> Job 10. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 10. The tenth Caſe is this; <hi>How may Repentance be known to be true, when 'tis a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95461:86"/> Death-bed Repentance? Or juſt before a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors Execution?</hi> It muſt needs be granted that Repentance at laſt is poſſible, and that's all; probable or uſual 'tis not. One inſtance we have in Scripture to hinder deſpair, and but one, to hinder preſumption. To dally and to delay in Religion, how dangerous is it? 'Tis perfect madneſs, willingly to lie under the wrath of God, under the Devils power, under the guilt and dominion of Sin, and upon the brink of Hell one minute longer. The longer you delay, Sin grows ſtronger, evil habits are more rooted, Satan entangles you faſter in his ſnare, the heart grows harder, the Spirit of the Lord is more grieved, and Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more difficult and unlikely. We have cauſe to fear, that many thouſands who talked of Repentance hereafter, have been ſurprized by Death, and have ſuddenly dropt into Hell before that <hi>Hereafter</hi> came. Well, but ſome at laſt have ſeem'd very penitent; and, How ſhall the truth of Repentance be diſcerned? Unto this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such who repent truely at laſt, <hi>are very ready to accuſe, and very ſevere in judging of themſelves:</hi> they give glory to God, and take ſhame to themſelves, they juſtifie the Lord in putting a period to their days; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he might juſtly <hi>laugh at their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95461:86"/> and mock at their fear, and diſtreſs, and anguiſh,</hi> and refuſe to pitty and pardon, and kill the Body and damn the Soul together. This judging of themſelves is a very good ſign, and there is a promiſe of eſcaping judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, condemnation; annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 31. For if we ſhould judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such who repent truely at laſt, are <hi>very jealous over their own Spirits,</hi> leſt the diſtreſs they are in, and the nearneſs unto death, be the only motive unto Repentance, therefore their cries are the more earneſt to be ſincere Converts. They prize new hearts, and beg that God would deliver them from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural guile and wickedneſs, and make them indeed new creatures. Oh, how do they long, not only for a pardon: but that they may feel the power of the renewing and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>Heal me and I ſhall be healed, turn me and I ſhall be turned, ſave me and I ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Jer. 17. 14. are their ſtrong cryes; and oh with what vehement deſires are they accompanied!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such who repent at laſt truely, are <hi>filled with an holy indignation,</hi> that all their time and ſtrength has been waſted in ſerving Sin and Satan, and diſhonouring that God that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95461:87"/> made them, &amp; to whom they owe themſelves. How angry are they and diſpleaſed at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that when they ſhould have been <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the Lords Vineyard,</hi> they either were <hi>ſtanding idle in</hi> the Market, or <hi>wrought iniquity with both hands earneſtly.</hi> Now this holy indignation is by the Apoſtle made an argument of <hi>ſorrowing after a godly manner,</hi> of <hi>repentance unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such who repent truely at laſt, <hi>do look unto Jeſus;</hi> Thus did the Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>Lord remember me,</hi> Luk. 23. 42. Chriſt is their hope, and the grace of God in him, which does ſuperabound, though Sin has never ſo much abounded. They look upon his Blood as the Blood of God, and able to do away the greateſt guilt, the fouleſt ſpot and ſtain, the moſt monſtrous defilements. They perceive that the Blood of Jeſus <hi>ſpeaks better things than the Blood of</hi> Abel, <hi>Heb. 12. 24.</hi> Cryes louder for Mercy and Salvation, than <hi>Abels</hi> did for Vengeance: Hereupon they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and enabled to act the faith of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and <hi>believing on Jeſus they ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6. Oh, how is this Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our now prized! How are they grieved at their former and ſo long continued neglect of him. And though the Lord forgets their Sins, they cannot but remember them; though he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95461:87"/> juſtifies them, they cannot ceaſe condemning themſelves, the truth is, they are <hi>aſhamed and confounded, and open not their mouths becauſe of their ſhame, though the Lord is pacified towards them for all that they have done,</hi> Ezek. 16. 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They who repent truely at laſt, have <hi>a care of Gods honour, and are willing to prevent others delaying their repentance.</hi> Their mouths therefore are full of cautions, they blame their own folly, and exhort others to grow wiſer, and while 'tis called to day, to harden their hearts no longer. The Earl of <hi>Rocheſters</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care was to have his <hi>prophane and lewd Writings burnt, as being only fit to promote Vice and immorality, by which he had ſo highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, and ſhamed and blaſphemed that holy Religion into which he was baptized, and all his obſcene and filthy pictures which were ſo notoriouſly ſcandalous.</hi> He wiſht his Son might never be one of thoſe <hi>wretched creatures who pride themſelves in abuſing God and Religion;</hi> adding, <hi>That no Fortunes or Honours were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the love and favour of God.</hi> To a Friend of ſome Note that came to ſee him, he thus expreſſed himſelf; <hi>Oh remember that you contemn God no more: We have been all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in our conceits and opinions, our perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been falſe and groundleſs, therefore God grant you repentance.</hi> And in his dying Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95461:88"/> ſigned before Witneſs, having bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pernicious opinions and vile practices, he thus ſpeaks to all whom he had drawn into Sin. <hi>I warn them in the name of God, and as they regard the welfare of their immortal Souls, no more to deny his Being, or his Providence, or deſpiſe his goodneſs; no more to make a mock of Sin, or contemn the pure and excellent Religion of my ever bleſſed Redeemer, though whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits alone, I, one of the greateſt of Sinners do yet hope for mercy and forgiveneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 11. The eleventh Caſe follows, which is this; <hi>How may Grace be diſcovered in Saints that are fallen?</hi> When I ſpeak of the falls of Saints, I mean not their Sins <hi>quotidianae incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi> of daily incurſion: for there is not a day, nor a duty wherein the beſt do not in ſome reſpect offend; but faults that are more groſs and offenſive, that approach nearer unto the nature of preſumptuous tranſgreſſions. That Saints do ſometimes thus fall is evident from Scripture and Experience, therefore all of them ſhould be the more watchful, &amp; humble, and cry to be upheld, living by faith on that God <hi>who is of power to eſtabliſh them,</hi> Rom. 16. 25. &amp; <hi>Rom. 11. 20. Well, becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith; be not highminded but fear.</hi> But when they do fall, there is a difference between the manner of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95461:88"/> theirs and others tranſgreſſing: 'tis ſaid of ſuch as are born of God, <hi>that they cannot ſin becauſe they are born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot ſin in ſuch a manner as the unregenerate do. I am to preſent to you a Child of Light under an Eclipſe, and yet even now there is a great difference between him and them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Saint when he falls, <hi>ſins not with the full conſent of his will:</hi> not only his Conſcience does declare againſt Sin, but even his Will ſo far as ſanctified and renewed is alſo againſt it. His purpoſe is <hi>to take heed to his ways, that he may not offend,</hi> Pſal. 39. 1. therefore when he falls he is ſurprized, and in the hurry of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and though in this hurry Conſcience is not heard, and corruption like a torrent carries him away, yet there is a ſecret diſlike of Sin which ariſes from the <hi>Spirits luſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleſh:</hi> Hence it is that Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take that delight in Sin which others do, becauſe their wills do not fully cloſe with the temptation. Though in <hi>Davids</hi> tranſgreſſion there was too much of deliberation and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, eſpecially in his carriage towards <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> yet if you conſider the matter, you may find he was in a hurry all along; firſt, he was hurried by a ſinful and inordinate affection, and afterwards by fear of ſhame, in caſe what he had done ſhould be diſcover'd.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95461:89"/> 2. A Saint though he may fall, yet <hi>does not ordinarily allow himſelf in Sin,</hi> neither does he make uſe of the falls of Believers which the Scripture records, as a plea for ſuch an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as wicked men commonly do. He looks upon the works of darkneſs as unfruitful, and deſires to have no fellowſhip with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe will hinder his fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. He cannot be called a <hi>Worker of iniquity,</hi> becauſe he prays with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and that ſincerely: <hi>Deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions,</hi> Pſ. 39. 8. and, <hi>Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes,</hi> Pſ. 119. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Saint never falls ſo far as <hi>to chuſe a new Lord and Maſter,</hi> he never wholly caſts off the yoke of Chriſt, nor reſolves to be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the law of ſin. Acts of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence indeed he may be guilty of; but when Satan propounds it to him, and perſuades him to renounce the Lords ſervice, and to give up himſelf to the ſervice of diverſe luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: he cannot bear the thought of it, for he knows the wages of ſin is death, and Chriſt is incomparably the beſt Maſter. He never conſents to be wholly under the bondage of corruption as once he was, but often prays, that <hi>no iniquity may have the dominion over him, Pſal.</hi> 119. 133. and eſpecially that he may be <hi>kept back from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> which are ſuch <hi>great tranſgreſſions,</hi> Pſal. 19. 13.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95461:89"/> 4. A Saint never falls ſo far as <hi>to take up with any portion beneath God himſelf.</hi> His <hi>Soul</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>The Lord is my portion,</hi> Lam. 3. 24. and he will never go back from it, or change his mind ſo as to become contented without God, and to have all his portion here in this life. Oh no, though he may go away from his Fathers houſe a while, and feed upon the husks that are abroad, yet he cannot be ſatisfied with theſe, for they are not bread: and as he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, ſo truely he is reſtleſs till he return to his Father again. His Soul remains empty till the Lord fills it; weary till the Lord ſatiates it; ſorrowful till God himſelf repleniſh it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Saint when he falls, is <hi>quickly brought to himſelf, and to his God by affliction,</hi> his heart ſhews its tenderneſs in yielding to the ſtroke and impreſſion of the Rod. <hi>Before I was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy Word,</hi> Pſ. 119. 67. And truely though there may be great fears of death when affliction overtakes a Saint in his falls, yet the new nature is ſecretly glad of affliction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fleſh may be tamed and corruption purged away. The backſliding Saint when he is ſtricken does not like thoſe. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Revolt more and more,</hi> but <hi>accepts the puniſhment of his iniquity,</hi> and deſires to be throughly <hi>turned unto God who ſmites him:</hi> and with his Soul he wiſhes the ſanctification of what he feels,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95461:90"/> and that the affliction may <hi>yield the peaceable</hi> and laſting <hi>fruits of righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 12. 11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A Saint after he has fallen, <hi>is very much afraid of Spiritual Judgments:</hi> he is afraid leſt the Lord ſhould utterly leave him, and ſay concerning him; <hi>He is proud, let him be proud ſtill,</hi> he is filthy, <hi>let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> he is fallen, <hi>let him alone. David</hi> after his Sin, dreaded being caſt away, and left to himſelf, and being given up to his own hearts luſts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> The holy Spirit had been exceedingly reſiſted and grieved, and had been highly and juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to depart, and that for ever. But <hi>David</hi> could not bear the thoughts of being deprived of the quickning, ſanctifying, comforting Spirit of God, therefore with ſuch concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs he deprecates his departure.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If the Saints falls have been foul, <hi>he is troubled at Gods diſhonour, and that he has cauſed his bleſſed name to be blaſphemed:</hi> 'tis his trouble that he hath wounded his own Conſcience, and this very much adds to his trouble, that he hath wounded Religion, and cauſed the way of Truth to be evil ſpoken of. To ſee fellow Saints grieving for his miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, is the grief of his Soul, to hear prophane ones ſcoffing at Religion, is his ſhame and confuſion; and to perceive them hardned
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95461:90"/> and ſtrengthned in their wickedneſs by the Sins he has fallen into, this makes his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be the greater. This was laid before <hi>David</hi> as the aggravation of his Sin, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it made a deep wound in his Spirit, that <hi>by the deed he had done, he had given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 14.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Saint after his fall <hi>riſes again, and begs that he may ſtand faſter.</hi> The Sun ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is Eclipſed a greater part, ſometimes half; and ſuppoſe it ſhould be a total Eclipſe, yet tarry a while till the Moon that interpoſed between the Sun and the Earth be gone, and the Sun will ſhine as it did before; the Saints will recover after their backſlidings, and ſhine as light again, though Sin may darken them for a ſeaſon. And when they do recover, Oh how do they cry not only for <hi>pardon,</hi> but alſo for <hi>cleanſing</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhment.</hi> Hark unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God,</hi> and <hi>renew a right</hi> or a conſtant <hi>Spirit within me.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> They are importunate with God to <hi>keep them from falling</hi> any more, <hi>and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy,</hi> Jude <hi>v. 24.</hi> To be upheld will be their joy, their exceeding joy, as their fall was their grief and trouble.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:95461:91"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 12. The twelfth Caſe is this; <hi>How may we know whether we grow in grace?</hi> The Saints in Scripture are compared to Trees, becauſe of their growth and fruitfulneſs: to the <hi>Cedar</hi> becauſe they are ſo firmly rooted: to the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> becauſe <hi>depreſſi reſurgunt,</hi> the weights of affliction upon them, make them grow the higher: to the <hi>Vine,</hi> becauſe the fruits of righteouſneſs which they bring forth are ſo exceeding pleaſant: to <hi>the Willows by the water courſes,</hi> becauſe there is an aptneſs in the new creature to grow apace, if there be not ſome impediment. But alaſs theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are too common: and where there is life, yet there may be a languiſhing and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering. Growing Chriſtians are more rare, eſpecially in this degenerate age. Now growth in Grace may thus be known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when our belief of the Goſpel has a ſtronger impreſſion:</hi> when things inviſible are lookt upon as the greateſt realities in the World, and we are affected and ſwayed by the view of them: When we can ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>that we walk by faith and not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7. If things ſenſible do leſs work upon us, if we are leſs troubled at ſenſible evils, becauſe they are light, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and work for good: if we are leſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſenſible good things, and enjoy them as if we enjoyed and poſſeſs'd them not;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95461:91"/> but things Spiritual and Eternal awaken our care and diligence indeed, becauſe we believe that theſe are infinitely of the neareſt and greateſt concernment; 'tis a ſign that our grace and faith has ſome ſtrength, and that we reſemble thoſe Worthies, who <hi>ſaw the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God,</hi> and <hi>declared plainly, that they ſought a better Country,</hi> than was to be found in this preſent World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then we grow in Grace, when <hi>our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil:</hi> This will prove us to be of a fuller age, and that we are diſtinguiſhed from ſuch as are but Babes, <hi>Heb. 5. 14.</hi> This diſcerning both good and evil, does not only imply ſoundneſs of judgment to perceive what is truth and what is error, that truth may be held faſt, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror under what form or diſguiſe ſoever it comes may be rejected: but ſeems to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the will and affections, and the good that is to be choſen, the evil that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. When good things have a greater reliſh with us than formerly, and Sin grows more and more diſtaſteful, this ſhews our Spiritual ſenſes are improved. <hi>Davids</hi> grace was much increaſed, when he ſaid, <hi>How ſweet are thy words to my taſte, yea, ſweeter than hony to my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119. 103. And <hi>v. 104. Through thy precepts I get underſtanding, therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95461:92"/>3. Then we grow in Grace, when <hi>heart Sins are quickly obſerved at the very firſt riſing of them, and in a greater meaſure mortified.</hi> When we are able to keep our hearts under our eye, and to check them in their very firſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaps from God, and reduce them preſently; When pride and hatred and paſſion, and envy cannot ſtir but they are inſtantly eſpied and beat down; when luſt and evil concupiſcence are taken notice of at the firſt kindling, and while in the ſpark, without delay quenched; this plainly ſhews the <hi>Spirit to be ſtrong,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does prevail againſt the <hi>Fleſh ſo quickly:</hi> Grace is certainly grown, when Sin is nipt in the bud, &amp; the Cockatrice in the Egg is cruſhed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when we are more weaned from the World.</hi> The Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were grown Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and they <hi>confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims upon Earth,</hi> Heb. 11. 13. <hi>David</hi> alſo was thus got above the World, when he ſaid, <hi>Surely every man walketh in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain, he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who ſhall gather them,</hi> Pſal. 39. 6. And <hi>v. 12. I am a ſtranger with thee and a ſojourner as all my fathers were.</hi> The World was ſo little and low in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s eſteem, that he prefers even <hi>affliction with the people of God, before thoſe pleaſures which was but for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. And <hi>v. 26. he eſteemed the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95461:92"/> reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of</hi> Egypt. When the World is thus gotten under foot, that the worſt of Chriſt is prefer'd before the beſt of the World, it argues ſtrength of faith whereby our victory over it, is ſo far advanced. When we are undiſturbed at changes we meet with here below, becauſe our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is in Heaven and out of reach; when with the Apoſtle <hi>we know how to want and how to abound;</hi> when we are not ſo much concerned about earthly things, becauſe they are not our portion: this plainly ſpeaks an increaſe of grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when we can readily deny our ſelves.</hi> When we are not wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our own wills, but are yielding and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto others, being clothed with humility, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 5. and eſpecially we ſubmit unto God, though his commands never ſo much croſs our natural and carnal inclination: when we can lay our Honour, our Eaſe, our Wealth, our Liberty, our Lives, at the foot of Chriſt, to be diſpoſed of in ſuch a way as He may be moſt magnified: now certainly there is much of the <hi>Spirit of glory and of Gods reſting upon us.</hi> How ſelf-denying, how bold and venturous was the Apoſtle, deſiring that <hi>Chriſt might be magnified, whether it were by life or by death, Phil. 1. 20.</hi> It argues much Grace, when the glory of God the Father and of Chriſt are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95461:93"/> dearer to us than our deareſt earthly comforts, and we count it gain to loſe any thing for Chriſts ſake. Oh brave <hi>Hebrews, who took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing that they had in Heaven a better and an endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubſtance,</hi> Heb. 10. 34.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when we truſt in God, though outward and viſible helps do fail.</hi> The Lord who made all the creatures, though he uſes means is not tied to them, but can work without, and againſt them: therefore though outward props fail, faith ſhould not fail, and if it be ſtrong, it does not. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17. 18. <hi>Although the Fig-trees ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines: though fields do yield no food, and flocks are cut off from the fold, yet will I joy in the Lord, and rejoyce in the God of my Salvation.</hi> The Creatures are inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient altogether. God alſufficient though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and a ſtrong faith dares truſt him by himſelf. Nay a ſtrong faith will rely upon him and follow him, notwithſtanding repulſes, denials, and diſcouragements. Thus the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> holds on in petitioning our Lord, though at firſt he was ſilent, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not a word, though he ſeemed not to regard the Diſciples interceſſion, though when he ſpeaks to her, he compares her to a Dog, and not fit to eat the Childrens Bread; yet ſhe gives not over, but retorts this diſcouragement;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95461:93"/> and turns it into an argument. <hi>The Dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their Maſters Table,</hi> hereupon her petition is granted, and her faith highly commended; <hi>O Woman great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 15. 28.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when the thoughts of God are more abiding and delightful, and our affections towards him are ſtronger:</hi> the more our hearts are the Lords, the more they muſt needs be enriched with grace, and in a greater meaſure ſanctified. When <hi>David</hi> was able to ſay, that the <hi>meditation of God was ſweet to him,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>That his Soul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hard after God,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8. and that he thirſted for God, for the living God, as the chaſed Hart pants after the Brooks of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Pſal. 42. 1, 2.</hi> This certainly did argue not only the truth of grace, but ſtrength alſo.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when we are not prone to be offended;</hi> Stumbling argues weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ſtumbling blocks will be got over by thoſe whoſe grace is ſtrengthned: When we hold faſt the truth, though many being <hi>led away with the error of the wicked, fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> as <hi>Athanaſius, contra mundum,</hi> ſtood up for the Deity and Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, though the World ſeemed to be turned <hi>Arrian;</hi> when perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95461:94"/> cannot affright us from our Duty: nor others Apoſtaſies make us diſlike Religion, but we are the more ſtedfaſt, and walk more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Lord: this ſhews that grace is much increaſed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Then we grow in Grace, <hi>when our fruit is really better than formerly for quality, and more for quantity.</hi> If we bring forth more fruit than in times paſt, it argues us more fruit than in times paſt, it argues us more purged. <hi>Joh. 15. 2. Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> When we are <hi>filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs,</hi> as this is to <hi>the praiſe and glory of God,</hi> ſo it declares, <hi>that he has made all grace to abound towards us, that we might abound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every good work,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 13. The laſt Caſe is this; <hi>How may we underſtand when our joy is true and well grounded?</hi> There is a <hi>joy of the Hypocrite:</hi> the Hearers compared unto the ſtony ground <hi>received the Word with joy:</hi> the <hi>Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in</hi> John, that <hi>burning and ſhining light for a ſeaſon;</hi> ſo that there is a great deal of falſe joy, which whoever entertain, <hi>they will lie down in ſorrow,</hi> Eſa. 50. 11. How then ſhall true joy be known? To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:95461:94"/>1. True joy <hi>follows after true ſorrow:</hi> they who <hi>reap in joy,</hi> do firſt <hi>ſow in tears,</hi> Pſ. 126. 5. Our Lord tells us, that <hi>the mourners are bleſſed for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Mat. 5. 4. <hi>Reſt</hi> is given <hi>to the weary and the heavy laden.</hi> That joy is ſinful and utterly unſeaſonable, where Sin is made light of and never was lookt upon as a burthen. But if we are humble and broken, and weary of all Sin, and of all that is in Sin, deſiring to be delivered from the force and filth, as well as from the guilt of it, and then are revived: we may conclude our peace is from the God of peace and comfort; for though he be the high and the <hi>lofty one who inhabits Eternity, yet he dwells with him that is of an humble and contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones,</hi> Eze. 57. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True joy <hi>has ever the Lord Jeſus for the foundation of it.</hi> Phil. 3. 3. <hi>We rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle: And <hi>Rom. 5. 11.</hi> If we <hi>joy in God,</hi> 'tis <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by whom we have received the atonement.</hi> The Comforter does ever <hi>glorifie Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to make us underſtand that all grace, mercy, and peace is given to us through a Mediatour. His ſorrows have purchaſed pardon and ſalvation, and the joy of that Salvation. The Churches joy is built upon the ſame Rock on which the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95461:95"/> Church her ſelf is built, and that <hi>Rock</hi> is Chriſt, therefore her conſolation is the ſtronger.</p>
            <p n="3">3. True joy is <hi>never without true holineſs.</hi> The Spirits ſanctification always goes before, and ever accompanies his conſolations. <hi>Peace and righteouſneſs do kiſs each other,</hi> where peace is of the right kind. <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdom of God is righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> A true Saint if he makes bold with Sin, his joy will be leſſen'd, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps loſt; <hi>his peace which has been ſpoken to him will be broken, if he return to folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. True joy is <hi>Spiritually rational,</hi> not an Enthuſiaſtical buſineſs: my meaning is, there can be <hi>good Scripture-reaſon</hi> produced for it. The Spirit of God works ſanctifying grace in the heart, increaſes that grace, and acts that grace, ſo that there is a powerful exerciſe of it, and then he does bear witneſs to the truth of it. The Spirit diſcovers unto the Soul, that he has made it willing <hi>to receive Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>hunger after holineſs,</hi> and willing to <hi>be the Lords and to ſerve him in ſincerity,</hi> and to <hi>eſcape the corruption that is in the World through luſt:</hi> and now his teſtimony of adoption is rational, and may be received as indeed the witneſs of the Spirit. Whereas when joys are but the fruits of ſtubborn and irrational impulſes:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95461:95"/> and the comforts of the Goſpel are applied without any Scripture ground; comfortable Scriptures are not brought by the True and Good, but by the Bad and lying Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. True joy is not <hi>a ſeal unto error and deluſion:</hi> Some have fallen away from the truths of Chriſt, and got above his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and caſt his Word behind their backs, and deſpiſed his Blood, and yet have bragg'd of Joy. Oh the ſubtlety of the Evil One! As he makes uſe of falſe Teachers, falſe Opinions, and falſe Hopes: ſo of falſe joys, to ruine Souls.</p>
            <p n="6">6. True joy is <hi>ſtrength to them that have it.</hi> Nehem. 8. 10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> Spiritual joy affords great ability to do the work of God, to bear Afflictions and Tribulations: and to reſiſt and overcome the Tempter, and the World, and the luſts thereof. The joyful Chriſtian is a man of might, he wreſtles with the principalities and powers of darkneſs, and is too hard for them: he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged at no difficulty in Religion, <hi>he mounts up with wings as an Eagle, he runs and is not weary, he walks without fainting,</hi> Eſa. 40. <hi>ult. he is faithful unto death</hi> and at laſt is reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>a Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. Thus have I reſolved all the <hi>Caſes</hi> I propounded: I come now to the <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:95461:96"/>
            <p>I begin with ſome <hi>inferences</hi> that may be drawn from this Doctrine, If this be true, that it highly concerns all to Examine and Prove themſelves; then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence I infer the <hi>miſery of Man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who is in darkneſs;</hi> ſo that till he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned from above, he is not capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding himſelf, his condition, or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Man by nature is under <hi>the power of darkneſs:</hi> of this power you read, <hi>Col. 1. 13.</hi> and how deliverance from it is to be valued. Darkneſs has a great power to keep men under Sin, to make them careleſs, ſtupid, and utterly unconcerned what becomes of them to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: therefore evil Angels are ſtayled, the <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World.</hi> Nay the Natural Man is in the abſtract, called <hi>darkneſs</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Eph. 5. 8. For ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Now, how can he that is in darkneſs look into himſelf, or look into the Lord? Oh the miſery of dark Souls! What unſpeakable danger are they in, and their not ſeeing their own peril does but the more increaſe it. We pitty a man that has ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained a breaking loſs, and does not know it: a Begger that being blind is near a precipice, and does not perceive it; but much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionable is the caſe of the Natural Man, who neither knows himſelf nor the things which concern his peace.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:95461:96"/>2. Hence we may infer the <hi>folly of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man who is ſo prone to cry peace unto, and to deceive himſelf.</hi> He loves to go upon ſure grounds in other matters, and is very ſerious about trifles, but wofully trifles in the weighty concerns of another World. Any thing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him, and makes him ſecurely to ſay, <hi>all is well.</hi> If Satan tell him as he did our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>that he ſhall not ſurely dye.</hi> Satan is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the God of Truth and the Word of Truth being diſregarded. How many when they hear the Words Curſe, <hi>do bleſs themſelves in their hearts, and ſay they ſhall have peace, though they walk on after the imagination of their evil heart:</hi> therefore the Lord threatens, <hi>that his anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt</hi> ſuch, <hi>and he will blot out their names from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven,</hi> Deut. 29. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Are they reproved for Sin? They ſay, <hi>All are Sinners:</hi> whereas Penitents forſake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins, and are willing to forſake all; but theſe Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluders, are hardly willing to forſake any. They bear up upon this, that <hi>God is merciful;</hi> and yet they ſlight and abuſe his mercy, preferring their vanities and luſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and go on to injure his Juſtice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to Jealouſie. They are full of hope, becauſe <hi>Chriſt died:</hi> and yet they thwart one great end of his Death, and will not be the better for it, for they refuſe <hi>to dye to Sin, and live to Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:95461:97"/>3. If it highly concerns all to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, hence we may infer, <hi>what an advantage it is to enjoy the light of the Word of God.</hi> This is a Glaſs that flatters none. It diſcovers what Sin is, and where it is. It calls Grace, Grace: and will ſpeak peace to them that are the Sons of peace; but on the contrary, it will tell the Sinner, though he be never ſo high in the World, never ſo high in his vain hopes; <hi>Thou art the man, that loveſt and liveſt in thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, therefore thou art under wrath, a Son of Death and in danger of eternal damnation.</hi> This word convinces of Sin, ſhews the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of turning unto God, and is a great means of Converſion; and afterwards by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of Grace, it proves the joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the heart. The Unbelievers and Ungodly need this Word, and ought to prize it, for it ſhews them their guilt and a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, their ſore and alſo a Phyſician, and faith is wrought by the hearing of it, <hi>Rom. 10. 17.</hi> The Saints have loved this Word exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; Hark how the Pſalmiſt cries out: <hi>Pſal. 89. 15. Bleſſed is the people that know the joyful ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we may alſo infer <hi>the benefit of a ſearching Miniſtery.</hi> Seers that will ſee vain viſions, are not worth hearing: and Prophets that <hi>propheſy only ſmooth things,</hi> had better
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95461:97"/> propheſy nothing at all, for they <hi>propheſy</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deceit. Such Prophets are guilty of the blood of Souls, and utterly ruine them while <hi>they heal them ſlightly, crying peace, peace, when there is no peace,</hi> Jer. 6. 14. Such Paſtors deſtroy the Lords Vineyard; ſuch Dawbers are not Builders of the Houſe of God. How ſad is it <hi>when the blind lead the blind;</hi> both they that are led, and they that are the leaders fall into the bottomleſs pit of perdition. But a plain dealing Miniſter, that rebukes Sin ſharply, that gives warning in time, to flee from eternal wrath: that <hi>commends himſelf to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God:</hi> that ſpeaks as if he knew mens hearts, and diſcovers their ſecret thoughts to them; that is a Son of thunder to the wicked, and a Son of conſolation to the broken hearted, and has the <hi>tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary,</hi> and heavy laden. Such a Shepherd is a great bleſſing to the Flock, ought highly to be eſteemed in love for his work ſake, and may be an happy inſtrument <hi>to ſave himſelf and them that hear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence we may further infer the <hi>great neceſſity of the Spirits aid.</hi> Unleſs he enlighten the eyes of our underſtandings we ſhall paſs a wrong judgment upon our ſelves, and every thing elſe alſo. A ſubtle Serpent, and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart will be too hard for the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95461:98"/> Preacher breathing: if the Spirit of the Lord does not ſecond and ſet home the word preached. The Spirit as I ſaid before, takes the Glaſs of the Law, and holds it before the Sinner, that he may ſee therein both his heart and life; and then, and truely not till then, he will cry out. Alaſs, alaſs! What have I been? What have I done? Where am I? And whither will my Sins at laſt bring me? The Spirit can charge Sin ſo home, that there is no denial, no excuſe made. The Sinner trembles, confeſſes, laments, begs pardon, conſents to forſake his wickedneſs. Thus <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> after he was inſtructed, is aſhamed and confounded becauſe of his abominations. The Publican being made ſenſible he was a Sinner, cries out, <hi>God be merciful!</hi> And as the Spirit convinces the Sinner, ſo he diſcovers to the Saint, what God has given him: not only the things themſelves which are great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but alſo the Saints intereſt in thoſe things. <hi>1 Cor. 2. 12. Now we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the Spirit of this World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know thoſe things. which are freely given to us of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If it highly concerns all to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; learn hence <hi>the hatred and ſubtlety of Satan in Staving men off from this duty.</hi> All his ſubjects are a company of inconſiderate fools, if they would but bethink themſelves, they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95461:98"/> would become wiſer than to ſerve ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. This Enemy cannot endure that wicked men ſhould look <hi>downward</hi> to Hell, for fear they ſhould be awakened and affrighted: nor that they ſhould look <hi>inward</hi> into themſelves, for fear they ſhould ſee themſelves loſt, and look out for a Saviour: nor that they ſhould look <hi>upwards</hi> unto God, for fear they ſhould be converted and healed. The Devil hates Souls, therefore is unwilling that any care ſhould be taken about them: he cannot abide that any ſhould inquire into their Spiritual ſtate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavours to divert them: he allures ſome with wealth, bewitches others with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, intoxicates others with applauſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; he repreſents Self-examination to be Self-tormenting, and holineſs a meer Hell upon Earth. But in all this he ſhews his falſhood as well as enmity. What madneſs is it to liſten to him as a Leader and Counſeller who is both a Liar and a Murtherer!</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence we may learn the <hi>great Error of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in crying down Aſſurance, and conſequently diſcouraging Self-examination.</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent, Seſſ. 6.</hi> has impiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd and declared, <hi>Certitudo remiſſionis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum, eſt vana, &amp; omni pietate remota fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi> The Saints <hi>aſſurance of the pardon of Sin, is a vain and ungodly confidence.</hi> How have they here blaſphemed againſt the Comforter,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95461:99"/> in making all his joys and conſolations, which ſuppoſe Sin to be pardon'd, altogether vain. The Scripture ſpeaks after another manner, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life;</hi> And <hi>v. 19. Hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him.</hi> This aſſurance was not the effect of a particular and extraordinary revelation peculiar to that firſt age of Chriſtianity: but was the reſult of thoſe charcters of Grace which are to be found even in the Saints now, as well as then. The conſolations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit were not confin'd to the Primitive times, but <hi>as a Comforter</hi> he is <hi>to abide with the Church for ever,</hi> Joh. 14. 16. And indeed thoſe who walk in the fear of God may expect the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The Apoſtle bids us to <hi>draw nigh with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. And 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10.</hi> We are commanded to give <hi>diligence to make our calling and election ſure.</hi> What impiety is it then to ſay, that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is an impious confidence. What is it that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not ſtrike at? She ſtrikes at our Liberties, at our Lives, would claſp the Book of the Goſpel, and lock it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95461:99"/> up in an unknown Tongue; She would baffle our very ſenſes, and lord it over our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and exerciſe dominion over our Faith, and rob us of our peace and comfort, and joy in Gods Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</hi> It may ſerve for a <hi>great and juſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> that this duty of Self-proving is ſo <hi>exceedingly neglected by the generality, even of thoſe unto whom the Goſpel is preached.</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes are as unconcerned what is likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them in another World, as if there were not a pin to chuſe between Heaven and Hell: as if eternal Life did not deſerve to be deſired, and eternal Death were not worthy of their fear. Men are willing to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thrive in the World; there is anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiring what the Parliament does, and what <hi>the times are likely to prove,</hi> whether peaceable and proſperous, or full of tumult and confuſion. But alaſs, alaſs! 'tis no part of the enquiry of the moſt among us; What <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is likely to prove to them,</hi> whether an Eternity of horror and woe; or an Eternity of joy and bleſſedneſs. A great number live in the prophane and total neglect of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will not give the Goſpel ſo much as the hearing; but truely there are alſo many who will pray, attend upon the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and profeſs high, and talk religiouſly, who never talk with themſelves, nor call their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95461:100"/> hearts to task, nor ſpeak ſuch language as this to themſelves.

            <p n="1">1. Theſe careleſs Sinners that prove not themſelves, <hi>know not themſelves;</hi> they know neither their Sore not the way of Cure, their Sins are hid from them, and ſo they muſt needs be ſtrangers to Repentance and godly Sorrow: they remember not their own wickedneſs, ſo as to mourn and condemn themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will remember it ſo to condemn and puniſh them. He that is ignorant of himſelf muſt needs remain impenitent and hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch <hi>do treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The not proving themſelves is <hi>the ground of Sinners preſumptuous confidence.</hi> Falſe hope cannot bear a ſerious Trial; but they that try not themſelves are full of ſuch hopes: and ſuch hopes the ſtronger, they are the more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. The hope of them that are Hypocrites and forget God, is compared to <hi>a Spiders Web,</hi> 'tis ſpun out of themſelves, but 'tis eaſily cut off; and they and their Hope ſhall periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

               <hi>Job 8. 13, 14.</hi> They that prove not themſelves, in how certain danger are they of building <hi>their houſe upon the ſand;</hi> And when the <hi>Rain deſcends and the floods come and beat upon their houſe, 'twill fall and great will be the fall of it,</hi> Mat. 7. 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that prove not themſelves, <hi>hide their faces and eſteem not the Lord of Life and Glory:</hi> they feel not their ſickneſs, they ſancy they are whole, and value not Phyſician; they are more afraid to be cured of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe than to die of it. They have no hunger, and ſo they ſlight the bread of life: they never were weary and heavy laden, and ſo they mind not him that alone can give them reſt; they never were thirſty in a Spiritual ſence, &amp; ſo the invitation is not hearkned to, to come and drink of the Water of Life freely; for want of proving themſelves, they know not in what a moſt wretched and loſt condition they are; no wonder then if they neglect great Salvation, and how ſhall ſuch eſcape? <hi>Heb. 2. 3.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape?</hi> He does not ſay <hi>what,</hi> to intimate that the puniſhment which will follow upon neglecting the great Salvation whereof Chriſt is the Author, is much ſorer than tongue can utter, or heart is able to conceive or reach.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They that prove not themſelves, <hi>know not what they are doing,</hi> they are breaking a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95461:101"/> Law moſt worthy to be kept with as great charineſs as the Apple of our Eyes: they are engaged in the ſervice of Sin whoſe wages is Death and Hell: they are the Devils Vaſſals, who hates and ſtrives to ruine thoſe who ſerve him with the greateſt labour; they are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Lord</hi> more and more <hi>to anger,</hi> and <hi>provoking themſelves to the confuſion of their own faces.</hi> 'Tis very bad and ſad work they are employed about, and becauſe they neither prove their work nor themſelves, they do not in a penitential way cry out, <hi>What have we done?</hi> But what they have done, they will do ſtill, whatever comes on't: therefore the Lord complains, <hi>Jer. 8. 6. I hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. They that prove not themſelves, <hi>know not whither they are going:</hi> theſe careleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſider not that their moſt pleaſant Sins will be as bitter and as deadly as the very gall of Aſps at laſt: that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is verified in them, <hi>Prov. 14. 12. There is a way that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</hi> The end of that broad way our Lord ſpeaks of his hid from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which go in it. They are <hi>blind, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95461:101"/> do not ſee afar off;</hi> nay, though Death is near at hand, and Hell follows immediately upon Death, yet they do not ſee it. Woe unto them, they fly from God, and they run poſt haſte towards ruine, and do not underſtand what dreadful and everlaſting deſtruction they are near, till they have actually and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed themſelves, and that beyond remedy. Thus the rich man in the Goſpel thought of nothing but taking <hi>his eaſe, eating, drinking, and making merry,</hi> till his Soul was required and loſt: and he was made to feel the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vengeance of eternal Fire.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Theſe careleſs Sinners who will not prove themſelves, <hi>their deſtruction will be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, unexpected, nay contrary to expectation, and ſo will be the more terrible.</hi> At preſent they mind not what they do, but <hi>God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all their wickedneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 2. And when he ſhall call them to an account for all, what horrour and confuſion will ſeize upon them! They thought the Lord as little regarded their Sins, as they did themſelves, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected after reckonings.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95461:102"/> that ever their wretched condition ſhould be alter'd. Oh then they will curſe their folly and madneſs, who before did bleſs themſelves: and their foregoing preſumption and ſecurity will make their pain and anguiſh, and deſpair to be the more intolerable.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Of Direction. And there are three great things which I ſhall give you directions concerning.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How to prove your ſelves ſo as to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto an aſſurance of the love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, How to prove your ſelves <hi>before you engage in that Ordinance of the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, How to <hi>prove and call your ſelves to an account every day,</hi> that you may walk with the greater circumſpection.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to direct you, how to prove your ſelves ſo as to attain unto an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the love of God. Before I come to the directions themſelves, I ſhall lay down ſome Arguments to perſuade all Saints to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Aſſurance, 'tis pitty and Saint ſhould be without it, 'tis pitty any of Gods Children ſhould be ignorant of that moſt near, and bleſſed, and everlaſting Relation, in which they ſtand to him. Now to make you prize
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95461:102"/> aſſurance at an high rate, and to give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to get it. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Aſſurance of the love of God, <hi>will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame your hearts with greater love to him.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſays in remarkable, <hi>1 Joh. 4. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> When you know that all your Debts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted freely, and that very <hi>much is forgiven you,</hi> you cannot chuſe but have much love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that forgave you. <hi>Cos amoris amor,</hi> Love is the whetſtone of love: Pray there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the manifeſtation of Gods love to you, that the light of his countenance may warm your hearts, and your Souls may love him with the greater ſtrength and ardency. Unbelieving doubts and fears have a natural tendency to chill and damp affection, whereas when you know that you are the Children of God, you cannot but love him as incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the beſt of all Fathers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Aſſurance of the love of God <hi>will fill you with joy and wonder.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that having received the atonement, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed joy in God, <hi>Rom. 5. 11. And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement.</hi> Well may the aſſured Believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for <hi>his name is written in Heaven:</hi> And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95461:103"/> there are no <hi>Errata</hi> in the Book of Life, no blots there made, no name ever razed out which is down there. And how may ſuch an one wonder, that the free grace of God ſhould make ſuch a difference between him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, between him and his former ſelf! When he was firſt loved, he was worthy to be loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was loved freely; for he was found <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing polluted in his blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Aſſurance of the love of God <hi>will take away the difficulty of Religion.</hi> When once you know that God is yours, Chriſt yours, the Promiſes yours, things preſent, and to come yours, you will not think much of any thing you are required to do, or part with. Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that you <hi>are dear Children</hi> will make you <hi>follow God</hi> indeed, <hi>Eph. 5. 1.</hi> and follow hard after him. Apprehenſion, that you are pleaſant to him, will cauſe you to take the more pleaſure in him and in his ſervice. An aſſurance, that God is ready to aſſiſt you in every piece of work he enjoyns you, ready to meet you in his Ordinances, and to be found of you when you ſeek him, and that he will not <hi>forget your labour of love,</hi> Heb. 6. 10. This will make you to love your labour, for <hi>your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58.</p>
            <p n="4">

The aſſured Believer may cry out, <gap reason="foreign">

How does the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> break out into thankſgiving upon this account, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3.

He has abounded towards them in Wiſdom, in Grace, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, in Love; Praiſe is a debt, Praiſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and Praiſe is comely: Though all his Works praiſe the Lord, yet Saints look upon themſelves as under a more ſpecial and peculiar obligation, to magnifie and bleſſe his Name.</p>

I deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and to be with Chriſt which is far better.</hi> Theſe are the Arguments (and are they not ſtrong ones?) to perſwade you to labour after Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Directions how to prove your ſelves, ſo as to attain this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Set ſelves as <hi>in the preſence of the All-Seeing and Heart ſearching God.</hi> Who knows you, who will judge you, and who alone can make you to know your ſelves. You cannot poſſibly deceive him, for <hi>every Creature is manifeſt in his ſight, all things are naked and open to his veiw. Heb.</hi> 4. 13. Your Spirits will be apt both to trifle and to juggle, unleſſe they are awed with a ſence of the Lords Omniſcience. Let Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſearching of you act as Gods Officer, and as Gods Officer in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and then it will deal the more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:95461:106"/>2. Pray that <hi>your Spirits may give a true Teſtimony concerning you.</hi> And that they may do ſo; you muſt be well acquainted with Scripture-ſigns and characters of true Grace, and then with great intention reflect upon your ſelves, to ſee whether you have the marks of Chriſts ſheep upon you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have the characters of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A wrong judgment of your ſelves how extreamly prejudicial would it be to you: Adjure your Spirits therefore in the name of the Lord to tell you the very Truth; and cry unto the Lord himſelf, that he would not ſuffer you to fancy or call your ſelves his Children, if you are really but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and ſtrangers to him, that you may not <hi>cry peace and ſafety;</hi> when God ſpeaks juſt the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be <hi>willing to find out every thing thats evil in you, in order to your more compleat purging. David</hi> prays, <hi>ſee if there be any evil way in me, and lead me in the way Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, Pſal.</hi> 139. 24. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. He deſires to be <hi>cleanſed from ſecret ſins,</hi> that nothing wicked might borrow the ſhape of lawful and good, and thereby abide in him.</p>
            <p>The more corruption is found our and mortified, the more fruitful you will be, <hi>John 15. 2. Every branch that beareth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95461:107"/> fruit he purgeth it that it, may bring forth more fruit.</hi> And the more fruitful you are, the more evident it will be that you are really the <hi>living branches</hi> of the <hi>true Vine,</hi> which is Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pray hard, <hi>That if you have any Grace, the Lord would increaſe it, and bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exerciſe, that it may be the more apparent.</hi> Little Grace is neareſt unto no Grace, much Grace is nearer unto Glory. When Grace lies dormant as it were and aſleep in the Habit, it may be doubted of, but when 'tis vigorouſly acted, the Truth of it will more eaſily be granted. Thus the Hare when ſhe ſits cloſe is not perceived, but when ſhe is ſtarted then ſhe is viſible to all. Pray there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reſemble the <hi>Theſſalonians whoſe Faith did grow exceedingly, and whoſe Love abounded. 2 Theſ. 1. 3.</hi> And that your Faith may work, and your Love put you upon labour, this is the way to have your ſpiritual eſtate cleared up to you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Find out and avoid what <hi>really nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and keeps up your Doubts and Fears.</hi> Entertain not high Thoughts of your ſelves, your gifts, your parts, your attainments; for deadneſs, and darkneſs, and doubting will follow upon ſpiritual pride. Check the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95461:107"/> 
               <hi>ſpirit in you which luſteth unto Envy, Jam. 4. 5.</hi> Abhor all laſcivious thoughts and motions at the firſt riſing of them. Let not any Earthly enjoyment get too high a room in your Heart, nor too large a ſhare in your Affections. Suffer not your Spirits to be ruffled and diſordered by paſſion and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs. In ſhort connive at no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but <hi>mortifie all your members upon Earth, Col. 3. 5.</hi> Not ſparing the right Hand, or right Eye. For if you deal gently with any of your luſts, and ſuffer them ever an anon to prevail, they will render your condition doubtful, and will be a ſtrong impediment unto Aſſurance and Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When you are proving your ſelves <hi>heed not Satan in his unreaſonable injections.</hi> You need not doubt but this Accuſer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will be very buſie, and uſe many wiles to hinder you from attaining peace of Conſcience. The Chriſtians comfort which is the Chriſtians Heaven upon Earth, is the Hell and Torment of this envious Spirit; therefore he does what he can to hinder it.</p>
            <p>He ſtarts a great many captious queſtions, in the minds of Humbled and Awakened ones. How do you know <hi>but that you are of the number of the not Elected?</hi> Is not the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95461:108"/> 
               <hi>day of Grace paſt, and the Spirit quite gone?</hi> Are you not <hi>judicially blinded and hardened?</hi> Can <hi>you ever hope for an intereſt in, and ſenſe of the Love of God, who have been ſuch rebels heretofore, and ſuch revolters and back-ſlinders, ſince a profeſſion of Religion?</hi> Sometimes this Enemy of ſouls will charge thoſe that are ſincere with hypocriſie in a moſt perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner; he tells them <hi>that all their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are a meer Abomination,</hi> that they <hi>have not one jot of ſaving Faith,</hi> that they are <hi>meer ſtrangers unto godly ſorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> that they have <hi>nothing at all of the Love of God in them. [Calumniare audacter aliquid haerebit,]</hi> Satan charges boldly, and thereby hopes ſomething will ſtick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoul will be diſquieted. But ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as theſe are not to be regarded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come from him that is called a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar;</hi> and it may be known they proceed from him, becauſe he proves not what he injects by Scripture; nay he overlooks all that the Scripture ſpeaks for the ſouls encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And his deſign in theſe injections is to make duty neglected, to drive ſouls to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; and to lay aſide the profeſſion and practice of Religion. Be altogether deaf to Satan perceiving his evil deſign, and pray <hi>that the God of peace would bruiſe Satan under your feet, Rom. 16. 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:95461:108"/>7. <hi>Add not unto the Word of God, Prov. 30. 6.</hi> My meaning is this, believe nothing either for or againſt your ſelves but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the written Word of God, rightly underſtood and applyed. Many queſtion their ſtate, becauſe their Hearts are ſo dead in Prayer; becauſe they find ſo much hardneſs and unaffectedneſs under Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Mercies, Afflictions; becauſe they fall ſo exceeding ſhort of what they would fain both be and do. But where does the Word tell you, that where there is true Grace <hi>all</hi> deadneſs and hardneſs of Heart is removed? Or that none are real Saints but who are <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> in Holineſs? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found <hi>evil preſent with him when about to do that which is good, Rom. 7. 21.</hi> And the beleiving <hi>Galatians,</hi> had fleſh as well as ſpirit, and this fleſh was very active, and <hi>luſted againſt the ſpirit ſo that they could not do the things which they would have done, Gal. 5. 17.</hi> You have ſpiritual life, elſe you would not have ſpiritual ſenſe to feel and be weary of remainders of corruption; you would not have a will to be, and do good; and ſtill to be and do better; if <hi>God had not wrought will this in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:95461:109"/>8. Be ſure <hi>not to thruſt away that conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Word of God hands forth to you, but humbly and thankfully accept it.</hi> Though the Heart be naturally deceitful above all things, yet ſo far as 'tis renewed it deals truly and ſincerely, and Conſcience being enlightned by the Word of God, is to be credittd in its Teſtimony, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 21. Beloved if our Heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the ſtricteſt ſearch your Hearts do witneſs for you <hi>that there are good things in you towards God,</hi> as it was ſaid concerning <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam, 1 King. 14. 13.</hi> If you find that God is preferred before the World; that you are willing to receive the Son as the way to the Father, and that you conſent, nay earneſtly deſire to be ſanctified throughout by the Spirit. You ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt your comfort, but gladly accept of the peace of the Goſpel, for you are the Sons of peace. You will grieve the Spirit of God, and add to your own grief, if you will not heed the Scripture ſpeaking plainly for you, and for your relief, and <hi>if your Souls refuſe to be comforted, Pſ.</hi> 77. 2. Take heed of raſh anſwers of your ſelves that you are rank Hypocrites, and that all the grace you have is but common
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95461:109"/> or counterfeit; unbeleif is not to decide, but the Word is to judge concerning the ſincerity of Grace, and if the Word ſpeak peace you are not to keep your ſelves under trouble.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hold <hi>on in ſelf-proving and praying,</hi> and reſolve never to give over trying and crying tell you know you are the Lords, and have the light of his Countenance. Tell him that his favour is better then life: and that you know not how to <hi>live,</hi> much leſs do you know how to <hi>dye,</hi> without the ſence of his Love.</p>
            <p>Be thankful for hopes and probabilities, but reſt not there, till you can ſpeak as the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, Chap. 6. 4. I am my Beloveds and my Beloved is mine,</hi> And as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. The Son of God loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> Beg that the Spirit may put all out of queſtion, and <hi>ſeal you to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> The Spirits Teſtimony is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, to bring us to an Aſſurance that we are the Children of God. Now this Teſtimony of the Spirit ſuppoſes that we are <hi>convinced of Sin and Righteouſneſs;</hi> it alſo ſuppoſes, that we are ſanctified in Heart and Life, in a degree; and long for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95461:110"/> perfect Holineſs. The Spirit then heightens the actings of Grace, and evidences the Change he has wrought, and makes us plainly to perceive, and feel that we hate our ſin, prize our Redeemer, and Love, and Fear, and Deſire after our God: And this real change in our Heart being eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then our relation unto God is alſo ſhewn; that we are the Children and Heirs of the Lord Almighty, that his love to us is Everlaſting, and his kindneſs ſhall never depart from us. Satans mouth is now ſtopt, and the Spirit cauſes the Conſcience from the Word to be quieted and ſatisfied; clouds are ſcattered, doubts and fears are removed, conſolation is ſtrong, and joy unſpeakable and glorious. Thanks! millions of Thanks be unto God, for the <hi>Mighty Comforter!</hi> Who gives a check to Hell, and ſays, <hi>Let their be Light and Joy,</hi> where before there was darkneſs and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſorrow: Who evidences Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love from Everlaſting, and cauſes Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Rapture of Spirit, in aſſured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of glory to Everlaſting!</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let me add one Word more, having attained Aſſurance of the Love of God, <hi>Take the right courſe to keep what you have gotten.</hi>

            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:95461:110"/>
            <p>Here I ſhall name a few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be low in your own Thoughts,</hi> if you continue <hi>humble,</hi> God will continue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="3">3. Take heed of <hi>preſumptuous ſins, David</hi> loſt his joy when he ventured to be unclean and bloody, nay take heed of <hi>leſſer ſins,</hi> for theſe will dead the Heart, grieve the Holy Ghoſt, and diſpoſe to greater.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be very ſerious <hi>in the Ordinances of Chriſt;</hi> if the Houſe, if the Table of the Lord be neglected, you will kill your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; frequent the <hi>Lords Temple,</hi> if you would ſee his <hi>Beauty,</hi> that is, his glorious holineſs, and have a continued ſenſe of his Love, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Study the <hi>unchangeableneſs of Gods Love in Chriſt, and the ſureneſs of his Covenant:</hi> This will be matter of perpetual gladneſs, to ſee your ſelves in the Heart, and hands of

            <p n="6">6. Walk continually in <hi>the fear of God.</hi> This is the way to have the Spirits Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout</hi> Judea, <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, <hi>and were edified, and walking in the Fear of God and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Uſe <hi>this World as not abuſing it,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31. If you are too much taken with worldly comforts, your ſpiritual ones will abate; but if in reference to earthly things you <hi>rejoice as if you rejoyced not,</hi> your joy in the Lord will be the greater. Look upon your ſelves as ſtrangers, and that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World is but the Houſe of your Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, then Gods ſtatutes will be your Songs, and fill you with the greater joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 54.</p>

            <p>To come to the Lords Table is a duty which Chriſt commanded when he was <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And if the words of a Dying Father, or of adying Friend, are remarked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, how much more the command of a dying Redeemer! The circumſtance of time is very obſervable, which the Apoſtle mentions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24. <hi>The ſame night in which he was betrayed</hi> the Lord Jeſus <hi>took the Bread and break it,</hi> to ſet forth his own being bruiſed and wounded, killed for the Tranſgreſſions of his People. He bids his Church <hi>Do this</hi> that they might remember what <hi>He their Head had ſuffered for them.</hi> When the Paſs-over was inſtituted, and was eaten at Evening, and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of the Houſe of Bondage. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, <hi>It was a Night much to be obſerved unto the Lord, Exod.</hi> 12. 42. Oh! How much more is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95461:112"/> that time to be obſerved when Our Lord Jeſus wrought a far greater and more glori-Redemption and Deliverance, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf <hi>delivered for our offences and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> he ſaved his Church from the Wrath of God, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils power, the Dominion of ſin, the ſting of Death, and the vengeance of Eternal Fire. Upon the firſt day of the week Chriſt <hi>ceaſed from his own works, as God did from his,</hi> upon the ſeventh day of the week: There <hi>remaineth therefore</hi> (the Greek Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a Sabbath or reſt unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, Heb.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>This Ordinance of the Supper is in no wiſe to be Adminiſtred unto all, though they be never ſo ungodly. We are indeed to <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> but there muſt be at <hi>least a profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel;</hi> or elſe perſons are not to be admitted to this Holy and Heavenly Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. Thoſe who are for Railing in the Communion Table, I wiſh they were for a Spiritual Rail of Scripture Diſcipline; and that in the Adminiſtration of theſe ſacred. Myſteries, there were a ſeparation made <hi>between the Precious and the Vile.</hi> In the more pure and ancient times, two ſorts of Perſons were debarred from the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95461:112"/> the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> and the <hi>Lapſi,</hi> the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and not well inſtructed in the Faith; and thoſe who had fallen into ſcandalous ſins. And why ſhould either of theſe be admitted now, <hi>to eat and drink Judgment to themſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent the incurring of the <hi>guilt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of receiving the benefits of the Blood of Chriſt, the Apoſtle preſcribes ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Now, That he who would be a welcom Gueſt at the Lords Table, may prove himſelf thorowly and to purpoſe; let him ſeriouſly and as in the Preſence of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unto himſelf theſe following Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Am I <hi>acquainted with or a ſtranger to the great things of the Goſpel?</hi> Do I know the <hi>Myſtery of God, and of the Father and of chriſt?</hi> Or is the black vail of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtill upon my Heart? The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome who have need to be taught <hi>which are the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, Heb.</hi> 5. 12. And am not I one of that number? How can I pretend to Faith in Chriſt or Love to God, if I have not ſo much as a notional knowledge of either?
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95461:113"/> The Communicant muſt have <hi>ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith. Here for his better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I ſhall lay down Ten Principles, which 'tis highly requiſite he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Communicant muſt know, That <hi>there is a God who is from Everlaſting to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting and every where preſent, a Spirit of incomprehenſible Wiſdom, Power, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs, the Maker and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Heaven and Earth, and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are therein, Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. Pſ.</hi> 147. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 34, 35.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This God <hi>is but One, and yet he is diſtinguiſhed into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, which have the ſame Godhead, Power, and Eternity,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 4. This Doctrine of the Trinity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that we may have right concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the True God when we Worſhip him. Excellent is that paſſage of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Orat.</hi> 40. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95461:113"/> One, but I am preſently ſtruck with the brightneſs of Three: I am not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Three, but I am preſently brought back to One again.</hi> We are alſo further to take notice how all theſe Three Perſons in the glorious Godhead do concur in that great Salvation, which is brought to light and offered in the Goſpel. The Father ſends the Son to become Man and Mans Saviour; the Son is made Fleſh, and puts away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf. The Spirit is ſent to convince men of ſin, and of their need of this Saviour, and to draw them to him, that beleiving in him they may not periſh but have Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Communicant muſt know; <hi>That Man was at firſt made upright. The firſt Man</hi> Adam <hi>had his Makers Image when firſt he was made, which Image did conſiſt in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and in having Dominion over the Creatures. A Covenant was made with</hi> Adam <hi>of Life and Immortality, upon condition of perfect Obeai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which then he had Power if he would to yeild; and he was threatned with Death if he did Eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95461:114"/> and Evil, Eccleſ. 7. ult. Gen. 1. 26. Epheſ. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10. Rom. 10. 5. Gen. 2. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The firſt man <hi>Adam being a publick perſon, and repreſenting his whole Poſterity, did ſin againſt God in Eating the forbidden Fruit; and all his poſterity,</hi> (Immanuel <hi>excepted, who being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt was Born of a Virgin) ſinned in him, and are Fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, ſo that all are Born the Children of Wrath, all have corrupted Natures, ſo that they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to every thing that is Good, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined unto Evil, in Thought, Word, and Deed, and every ſin being a Tranſgreſſion of the Holy Law of the great God, the Deſert and Wages of it is no leſs then Death and Hell. Rom. 5. 14. Gen. 3. 6. Rom. 5. 12. Rom. 3. 23. Luke 1. 35. Epheſ. 2. 3. Gen. 6. 5. 1 Joh. 3. 4. Rom. 6. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Eternal Son of God did take mans Nature upon him, but was perfectly free from Sin; and ſuffered in that Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, and his Blood is ſufficient being the Blood of him that is God and Man, to cleanſe from ſin, and to make peace, and he is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95461:114"/> able to ſave unto the utter moſt all that come unto God by him, neither is there Salvation in any other, Heb. 2. 16. Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8. Act. 20. 28. 1 Joh. 1. 7. Col. 1. 20. Heb. 7. 25. Acts 4. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Communicant muſt know, <hi>That Chriſt after his Death and Eurial, did riſe again the third day, which ſhewed that the price he paid for his Churches Redemption was ſufficient; and having Forty days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed upon Earth, with his Diſciples, and been ſeen of ſeveral other Witneſſes, even Five Hundred Brethren at once, at length he did Aſcend into Heaven, and is at the Right Hand of God, to make Interceſſion for them that Beleive in him; and from Heaven where he now is, He ſhall be at laſt revealed with Power and great Glory, to Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, Rom. 4. ult. 1 Cor. 15. 3, 4, 5, 6. Luk. 24. 51. Rom. 8. 34. 2 Theſſ. 1. 7. Matth. 25. 31. Acts 17. 31.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Chriſt has <hi>three Offices Prophetical, Preistly, and Kingly; As a Prophet he does Teach his Church; and who teacheth like him? As a Preiſt he has made ſatisfaction, and does intercede for them: And as a King
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95461:115"/> he does Govern and Defend them. And this Church of his are Called, Juſtified, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall be Saved: And though Earth and Hell hate them, yet there ſhall be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other, a Church of Christ always unto the end of the World. Acts 3. 22. Heb. 4. 14. Heb. 10. 14. Rev. 19. 16. Pſ. 3. ult. Rom. 8. 30. 1 Cor. 6. 11. Matth. 28. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The Communicant muſt know, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt did move and inſpire the Penman of the Holy Scripture, ſo that 'tis of Divine Authority, and contanis all things needful to be known, beleived, and done; in order to Salvation: The Books of the Old and New Teſtament are to be received as the Word of God. Thoſe therefore that lived under the Old Teſtament had ſome Knowledge of Chriſt and the Goſpel; and were ſaved no other way but by him: But under the New Teſtament, Chriſt and the things of our peace are much more fully revealed, 2 Pet. 1. ult. 2 Tim. 3. 16. Pſ. 19. 7. 2 Tim. 3. 17. Eph. 2. 20. Acts 26. 22, 23. Matth. 13. 17. 2 Cor. 3. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. There is a <hi>New Covenant which God has made with his people who Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95461:115"/> into which Covenant he has alſo taken their Infant Seed, and therein he has promiſed to be their God, to pardon Sin, to give Grace; after Death to raiſe them up at the Laſt day; and to beſtow upon them Life Everlaſting, and this Covenant as it was under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirmed by Circumciſion and the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſo under the New, 'tis confirmed by Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, which two Sacraments are the Seals of it, Heb. 8. 8. 10. 12. Acts 3. 19. Acts 16. 31. Acts 2. 39. Joh. 6. 39. 40. Rom. 6. ult. Rom. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 5. 7. Matth. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25. 1 Cor. 10. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The Communicant muſt know, <hi>That the Law of God is not Aboliſhed but Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Faith as a Rule of Righteouſneſs for Chriſtians to walk by. And ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law and Goſpel through Chriſt ſhall be Accepted and Rewarded; but thoſe who live and dye <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleiving, Impenitent, and Diſobedient, ſhall ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire; and their Condemnation will be ſoreſt, who have been often offered, but have neglected great Salvation, Rom. 3. ult. 1 Joh. 2. 1. 1 Cor. 15. 58. 1 Pet. 2. 5. 2 Theſſ. 1. 8. 9. Heb. 2. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:95461:116"/>
            <p>Theſe are the Ten Principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion which the Communicant is to Catechize himſelf about. There muſt be <hi>Light</hi> in the Head, that is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, though it be not ſufficient; for there muſt be alſo <hi>Grace</hi> in the Heart, to qualifie a man for the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Communicant ſhould further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and ask himſelf this queſtion. <hi>Do I apprehend the danger of unworthy Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Is not the guilt of Blood heavy? And what is it then to be guilty of the Blood of God? But if <hi>I Eat and Drink unworthily I am guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 27. What a fearful thing is it to Crucifie the Son of God afreſh? To trample him under Foot, and to eſteem his Blood a common and an unholy thing? My Heart riſes againſt the Jews becauſe they Mocked, Scourged, Buffeted, Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord of Life and Glory; but this they did in his Humiliation here upon Earth. And ſhall I dare to put an affront upon him, now he is at the right Hand of the Almighty Majeſty on High? If I Eat and Drink unworthily I pull the Blood
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95461:116"/> of Chriſt upon my Head inſtead of having my ſin pardoned, and my Heart cleanſed and ſanctified by it, and I Eat and Drink my own damnation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another queſtion the Communicant ſhould propound to himſelf is this; <hi>Have I a right conception of Goſpel Worthineſs?</hi> The Worthineſs ſpoken of in the Goſpel, does not imply any Merit or Deſert, for Chriſt the Son is given out of the Tranſcendent Love of God, and <hi>with him freely all things, Rom. 8. 32.</hi> The Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged he could not lay claim to the leaſt of all Mercies, as a due debt. Our daily Bread is a Gift, and how much more the Bread of Life? Worthineſs therefore is as much as <hi>being diſpoſed and made meet</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the Lord in the Supper is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to beſtow. When we are ſenſible of our own unworthineſs, and guilt, and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then we are made meet to be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; looking unto the Beloved, and to be Juſtified by his Meritorious Righteouſneſs: When we are ſenſible how weak and empty and diſtempered our Hearts are, then we are Worthy, that is to ſay, made meet to be ſtrengthened and filled, and healed by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95461:117"/> the great Phyſitian of Souls, in whom <hi>it hath pleaſed the Father all fulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Communicant ſhould ask himſelf. <hi>Do I look upon admiſſion to the Table of the Lord as a mighty priviledge?</hi> He was no leſs then a King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who thought it a great favour to be <hi>a doorkeeper in the Houſe of God,</hi> and what is it then to be a welcom gueſt at his Table? What is it to be <hi>brought into his Banquetting Houſe where the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over his People is love, Cant.</hi> 2. 4. Our Lord in this Ordinance deals forth Light and Grace, and Comfort bountifully. Here Tears have been dried up, fainting Souls have been revived, and Faith ready to fail hath been ſtrengthned, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Hope hath been made lively. The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt being applied, has proved a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> medicine for every malady, and hath ſent away the ſin diſtreſſed Soul, both clean and calm, both pure and alſo peaceable. Is it not a mighty advantage, and an Heart effecting and endearing ſight, to ſee the Blood and the Love of Chriſt ſtreaming forth together? Here is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Love that paſſeth knowledge, Eph.</hi> 3. 19. Oh with what confidence may humble and hungry ſouls go to this Jeſus
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95461:117"/> who is ſo full of Love, and ſo full of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which they Hunger after, he would have none to content themſelves with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but his language is, <hi>Eat O Friends, Drink yea, Drink abundantly O Beloved. Cant.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Communicant ſhould ask himſelf, <hi>Do I know what it is to diſcern the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 29. My bodily Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Sacramental Bread and Wine, but have I an Eye to behold ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and better? If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, did behold an Healer and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our when <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; if the Beleivers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did ſee a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the legal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; though as yet he was not manifeſted in the Fleſh; ſurely ſince the Son of God is come, and has been actually offered up to bear the ſins of many; ſhall I not behold this Jeſus in the Bread and Wine broken and poured out; where he is ſo evidently ſet forth as Crucified?</p>
            <p>What is it to diſcern the Lords Body? Verily 'tis to <hi>look beyond</hi> the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Body and Blood of Chriſt which thereby are repreſented; and <hi>to relye</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:95461:118"/> upon that very Jeſus who was Crucified without the Gates at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Mortification of <hi>our</hi> iniquities in particular; and that our wants of Grace and Strength, and Comfort, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed out of his ſuperabundant fulneſs. Moreover the Beleiver ſhould grow confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and be perſwaded, that as really as the Bread and Wine are given him; ſo real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt beſtowes himſelf, and his benefits upon him, in this Bleſſed Ordinance. Hark to the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16, The cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we brake, is it not the communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> The Communicant ſhould ask himſelf, <hi>Do I ſee my ſelf loſt in my ſelf, and do I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'tis in vain to hope for Redemption any other way but by the Lord Jeſus?</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle has a notable expreſſion when he ſpeaks of being <hi>ſhut up unto Faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 23. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that all other doors are ſhut againſt the Sinner; only the door of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is open. We cannot reaſonably hope for the Forgiveneſs of ſin, or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God any other way but by him, who is ſufficient to be <hi>a propitiation for the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95461:118"/> ſins of the whole World.</hi> There were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſacrifices under the old Law, which were appointed by the Lord him ſelf: and yet the ſins of the Sacrificers could be done away by none of them: The Apoſtle tells us plainly, that 'tis <hi>impoſſible the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſin, Heb.</hi> 10. 4. And if the ſacrifices that were of Divine inſtitution could not do it; ſurely thoſe of humane invention could do it leſſe, though never ſo coſtly, though we ſhould <hi>give our first Born for our Tranſgreſſion, the Fruit of our Body for the ſin of our Soul, Mic.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
            <p>No active Obedience that we can yeild, can juſtifie us before God, for the Apoſtle peremptorily aſſerts that there is <hi>no Law giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which can give Life unto him</hi> that obeys it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. Nay further our greateſt ſufferings for Righteouſneſs ſake, are inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs. Therefore thoſe who come out of great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, are ſaid to have <hi>waſhed their Robes,</hi> not in their own Blood, though that was ſpilt for the Word of God, and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt, but <hi>in the Blood of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:95461:119"/>7. The Communicant ſhould examine and ask himſelf, <hi>Am I perſwaded that Jeſus who dyed upon the Croſs, is able to ſave to the uttermoſt and willing to ſave all that come to him?</hi> Jeſus is the man who is <hi>Gods Fellow,</hi> he thought <hi>it no Robbery to be equal with God, Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. He is indeed the <hi>true God and Eternal Life, 1 John</hi> 5. 20. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then Help is laid upon One that is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and that has ſufficient power to ſave. Jeſus is he who was <hi>fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20. And pitcht upon in Gods purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to be the Redeemer of loſt Man, and at laſt he was made manifeſt; having been Typified and Beleived in long before. He undertook to be Mans Surety, and to pay the price for his Redemption. And juſt when he was dying he cryes out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and then gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. As if he had ſaid, <hi>I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took</hi> to <hi>ſatisfie Divine Juſtice</hi> that had been wronged, and to <hi>appeaſe the Anger of God</hi> which had been provoked by the ſin of man; I undertook to <hi>remove the Curſe of the Law,</hi> to conquer and <hi>Redeem from Death and Hell;</hi> and quite to <hi>ſpoil the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> I undertook to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95461:119"/> 
               <hi>Ranſom precious Souls</hi> that were loſt; and <hi>Purchaſe a Church,</hi> that may come at laſt to live with me and my Father, and ſhout forth Hallelujahs unto Him that ſits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb forever! And this great work which I undertook I have <hi>now finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe the Lord Jeſus is able to ſave, and his willingneſs he declares abundantly. The Communicant ſhould thus argue with himſelf. <hi>O! My soul! Is not Jeſus a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful High Preiſt as well as a Mighty Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Behold him Weeping over</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Inhabitants whereof were Enemies to him, and would not be gathered: And wiſhing they had known the things of their Peace; and will he not with Joy receive thoſe that come to him, and put their Truſt under the ſhaddow of his Wings? Hark does he not ſay,</hi> I will give reſt to the weary and heavy laden? <hi>Does he not aſſure thee, that thoſe that come to him,</hi> he will in no wiſe caſt out? <hi>What though thou art utterly unworthy; Chriſt ſaves none but ſuch, for 'tis his deſign that they may cry,</hi> Grace, Grace, <hi>forevermore.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. The Communicant ſhould ask himſelf, <hi>Do I look upon the New Teſtament and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95461:120"/> whereof Jeſus is the Mediator as ſure and Everlaſting? David</hi> ſpeaks excellently concerning this, 2 <hi>sam. 23. 5. God hath made with me an Everlaſting Covenant order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things and ſure; this is all my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all my deſire.</hi> This Covenant is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things,</hi> becauſe the Promiſes of it are ſo admirably ſuited unto the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of poor ſinners. The Lord here Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes Mercy to the Miſerable; Pardon to the Guilty; Cleanſing to the Defiled; Healing to the Diſtempered Soul; Liberty to the Captives; Light to the Blind; Reſt to the Weary; Satisfaction to Empty; Strength to the Weak; Eſtabliſhment to the Wavering; and Salvation to the Loſt: And becauſe all things elſe are inſufficient to make them happy, the Lord Promiſes that he himſelf will be their God, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their Portion, and that forever and ever. And what more can be deſired? Now this Covenant is as ſure as the Word, the Oath, the Seal, the Truth, the Power, the Love, the Blood of God can make it.</p>
            <p>This Covenant is ſometimes ſtyled a Teſtament, and in this Teſtament Chriſt has bequeathed the greateſt things unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95461:120"/> here we find the richeſt Legacies that ever were left. The favour of God, the Sanctifying Spirit, a New Heart, Peace of Conſcience, Joy unſpeakable, the good things of this preſent World, Grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to the end, and a farr more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory hereafter, are the things bequeathed by our dying Lord. And the Teſtatour having dyed, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is of force, and ſtands firm and faſt forever, <hi>Heb. 9. 15, 16, 17. O my Soul!</hi> ſhould the Communicant then ſay, <hi>Set thy ſelf to Study the Covenant of thy Lord. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great things are made over, and how firm the ſettlement is! Be pacified, O! My conſcience with the promiſes of Pordon. Embrace O my very Heart, the Promiſes of purity, that by theſe I may be</hi> made a partaker of the Divine Nature, and eſcape the Corruption that is in the World through luſt: <hi>Rejoice, O! My Soul, in this higheſt Happineſs that God in Chriſt is Thine! And Triumph, O! My Spirit in hope of that Glory that moſt certainly and very ſhortly is to be Revealed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The Communicant ſhould examine and ask himſelf. <hi>Am I willing to break the League Eternally between my Heart and my Luſts?</hi> Do I conſent to have all the deeds
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95461:121"/> of the Body mortified without exception? Under the Law the Inticerto Idolatry was to be deſtroyed how neer ſoever. <hi>If thy Brother or thy Son, or Daughter or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend which is as thy own Soul, intice thee ſecretly, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods and ſerve them, thou ſhalt not conſent nor hearken to him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thy hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to Death, and after the Hand of all his People, Deut.</hi> 13. 6. 8, 9. And the reaſon is aſſigned, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Becauſe he ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God.</hi> There is never a ſin or luſt which thou canſt indulge, but the tendency of it is to thruſt thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Lord thy God. No ſin therefore upon any account is to be ſpared. Search thy ſelf therefore for corruption is a lurking thing. Unfeignedly deſire to have all this old Leaven purged out, that thou mayſt be fit to feed on Chriſt the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</p>
            <p>Speak thus: <hi>O! My Heart! At last lay aſide thy deceitful dealing, and tell me truly as thou wilt anſwer it another day, whether love to ſin is turned into hatred? Doſt thou give conſent that thy pride, thy paſſion, thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean affections, thy love of the World, and all
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95461:121"/> other ſins ſhould be Crucified? Doſt thou ſlight ſinful delights, that thou mayeſt taſte the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs and peace, which is in Wiſdoms wayes? Doſt thou eſteem Godlineſs to be greater gain; then any wickedneſs can yeild?</hi> Oh! cheriſh none of thy iniquities, for one ſin allowed, will make the Supper, and all other Ordinances ineffectual to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prove thy utter and Eternal Ruine. Juſt as one Dagger thruſt into the Heart, will diſpatch a man as certainly, as if he had as many wounds given him as <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate, or <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> in the nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Barrel.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Communicant ſhould ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Have I a Spiritual Appetite, do I hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs? Mat.</hi> 5. 6. Do I count Holineſs the Glory of God, and the trueſt Glory of Man? Do I ſee a deformity in wickedneſs, and an excellency in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteous? Do I deſire to <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> and <hi>that New man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs? Eph.</hi> 4. 24. Are my prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Holineſs removed, as if 'iwere unwiſe, uneaſie, needleſs, and a thraldom to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>O my Soul, what doeſt thou long for, when thou comeſt unto thy Lords Banquet? Is it not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95461:122"/> that thy Faith may be ſtrengthened? that thy love to God may be more hot and flaming? Is it not that thy fear may be greater, and more fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial? and that thou mayeſt be inabled to follow thy heavenly Father more fully as a dear Child? Is not ſanctifying Grace preferred before Gold that periſhes? doſt thou not long that the new Creature may be more lively in all the actings of it? and that thou mayeſt become ſtronger in Spirit.</hi> If it be thus, it is a ſign thy Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Appetite is ſharp and keen; and as the Supper is an ordinance proper and ſuitable to thee; ſo there is enough, and enough to fill thee, and thou ſhalt not be ſent away empty for the promiſe is <hi>open thy Mouth wide, and I will All it.</hi> Pſal. 82. 10.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Communicant ſhould examine and ask himſelf. <hi>Do I count the World but loſs that I may gain Chriſt,?</hi> Has he the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in my affections above all things viſible, above all perſons breathing? Where Faith is true, <hi>Chriſt is precious, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 7. And Chriſt is not truly prized <hi>at all,</hi> unleſs he be prized <hi>above all.</hi> The young man in the Goſpel lacked <hi>one thing,</hi> and that was the main; Love to Chriſt above his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thoſe were not fit to taſte of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95461:122"/> Supper,</hi> who preferred their <hi>Oxen</hi> and their <hi>Farms,</hi> and their <hi>Merchandize</hi> before it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. Our Lord expreſly requires us to undervalue what is deareſt in this World in compariſon of him. Luk. 14. 26. <hi>If any man come to me and hate not</hi> i. e. leſs Love, <hi>his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo,</hi> and what can be named dearer? <hi>he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speak therefore thus to thy ſelf. <hi>O my Soul! has thy Saviour and Lord indeed the higheſt room in thee? Corruptible things as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold are unſuitable to thy nature, which is ſpiritual; and were inſufficient to be the price for thy Redemption. The world has often prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſnare to thee, but Chriſt is a Saviour; the World is vanity, and leſs then nothing, but Chriſt is all in all: the World has often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and vexed thee; but Chriſt can eaſe and ſatiate and repleniſh thee. The World, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou hadſt ruined thy ſelf? was ready to help forward thy deſtruction. But Chriſt has the key of Hell, and can keep thee out of it; and the key of Heaven, and can give thee an abundant entrance into that everlaſting Kingdom.</hi> If Chriſt can do more then the World can; nay if Chriſt can do all for a Soul, and the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95461:123"/> world can do juſt nothing at all: 'tis but reaſon that Chriſt ſhould infinitely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Communicant ſhould ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Am I reconciled to the Commands of God?</hi> Am I willing that my Heart ſhould be Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the Spirit to write his Laws upon? that I may delight to do the will of God. Do <hi>I eſteem</hi> not only ſome but <hi>all the Lords precepts,</hi> concerning, not only ſomethings, <hi>but concerning all things to be right? and do I hate every falſe way?</hi> Pſ. 119. 128. <hi>O my Soul ſpeak, Art thou irritated by the Law of God as formerly? are the motions to ſin ſtronger and more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe the law forbids Sin? Or is the Law of God dear to thee? and art thou ready to ſay at the hearing of every Command, Oh that my wayes were directed that I might keep this Statute?</hi> The ſtronger Grace is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God are farther off from being grievous. You may perceive how <hi>David</hi> was affected towards them, when he ſaid Pſal. 19. 10. <hi>More are they to be deſired then Gold, yea then much fine Gold. sweeter alſo then Honey, and the droppings of the Honeycomb.</hi> And where Grace is weak, though there be an untoward backwardneſs remaining to yield obedience to the Law: that backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95461:123"/> is lamented, and a Burthen, and the heart longs to be <hi>enlarged, that it may run the wayes of Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. 32.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Communicant ſhould examine himſelf. <hi>Am I willing to receive whatever Chriſt has purchaſed, and is willing to give in this ordinance of the Supper?</hi> Is every benefit of Chriſt lookt upon as worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? All the benefits of Chriſt are dear; ſurely all of them are of great value. And there is not one of them that we can be well without, for theſe benefits are excellently ſuited unto our neceſſities. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> ſhould the Communicant ſay, <hi>thou likeſt the Lord Jeſus as he is made unto thee</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>as he skreens thee from the Wrath of God, and interpoſes between thee and everlaſting ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; But doſt thou ſee thy need of his</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>to direct thee in the way of Truth, and to make all the wiles of the subtle Serpent of none effect? And to make thee wiſe to Salvation, and for Eternity? Doſt thou value Chrict as made</hi> Sanctification <hi>and</hi> Redemption? 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>Doſt thou count deliverance from all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity a great and deſirable part of Redemption? and Sanctification a great and deſirable part of Salvation, becauſe hereby thou art ſaved from thy pollutions and defilements?</hi> Certainly as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95461:124"/> there is no ſin which ſhould be loved, ſo there is nothing in ſin to be liked; and there is no thing in Chriſt but what is highly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be eſteemed.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Communicant ſhould examine and ask himſelf. <hi>Am I grieved when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I have done againſt God and the Lord Jeſus?</hi> Is it indeed the trouble and Affliction of my Soul, that I have ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and forwardly, and ſo long rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the beſt Lord; and been diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the beſt Father? Do I mourn and would I mourn a great deal more becauſe I have dared the power of God, ſlighted his preſence, contemned his favour and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; hated his holineſs, abuſed the riches of his Grace and Mercy? <hi>O my Soul how fooliſh and unwiſe haſt thou been thus to requite the Lord that made and bought thee. How great an evil has it been in it ſelf, and how evil has it been for thee, that thou haſt</hi> forſaken the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Living waters? <hi>Mourn that thou haſt left ſuch a God, and mourn the more kindly becauſe ſtill he is willing to receive thee. See O My Soul, how thy ſin has peirced the only Saviour. Behold him in an Agony, behold him ſweating drops of Blood firſt; and after ſhedding all upon the Croſs: See a ſorrowful
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95461:124"/> Life ending in a Death more lamentable. Harken to thy Redeemer, crying out,</hi> My God my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me. <hi>Behold the son of Righteouſneſs ſetting in a Cloud, and ſin, thy ſin the cauſe of all this.</hi> Break, break hard Heart! Let his Blood and Love together melt thee into Godly ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Communicant ſhould Examine himſelf, <hi>Am I willing to give to Chriſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is willing to have?</hi> Can I lay all that I have and my ſelf too at his feet? And not complement or diſſemble with him, when I ſay, I and all is at his ſervice? Do I yeild my whole Heart, my whole Man unto my Lord without any reſerve? As Chriſt gave himſelf for me, and gave himſelf to me, ſo am I perſwaded that I cannot diſpoſe of my ſelf better or ſo well, as to give up my ſelf to Him? <hi>O My Soul is any thing too much, too good, or good enough for Jeſus? Behold God in the Fleſh, in the Manger, upon the Croſs, and in the Grave, and if he condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, obeyed, and ſuffered, and purchaſed ſo much for thee, O Be perfect and intire in the reſignation of thy ſelf to him.</hi> Thou read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of a Nonſuch Convert, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 25. And that was <hi>Joſiah.</hi> Like <hi>unto him there
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95461:125"/> was no King before him, that turned unto the Lord with all his heart and with all his Soul, and with all his might, neither after him aroſe there any like him.</hi> Surely 'tis thy duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to write after this excellent pattern.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Communicant ſhould ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Am I deſirous to be faithful in Gods Covenant to the laſt Breath?</hi> Do I count I obtain great mercy when I am made thus faithful? Have I counted the coſt of being a Diſciple? And is my love of the Lord and of Godlineſs greater then my fear of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Do I diſtruſt my corrupt and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature, and beg that my Lords Grace may be ſufficient? <hi>Look, O My Soul as thy Head did unto the Joy that is ſet before thee, and ſtart not at the Croſs which is the way to the Crown. Perſecution will ſit thee for Heaven, &amp; may ſpeed thee thither. Fear not men ſince the worſt is the beſt they can do; that is, ſet thee by Death out of their reach, and ſend thee to thy Fathers houſe and boſom. Faint not at Troubles,</hi> for theſe light afflictions which are but for a moment do work <hi>for perſevering Saints</hi> a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:95461:125"/>17. The Communicant ſhould Examine himſelf, <hi>Am I taught of God to love my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? 1 Theſſ. 4. 9. Bitterneſs and Wrath and Anger and all kinde of Malice</hi> is leaven that is to be purged out. All that come to the Table ſhould <hi>put on as the Elect of God Holy and Beloved, Bowels of Mercies, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs, Long-Suffering: Forbearing one another, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another; if any man have a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt any, as Chriſt forgave them, ſo alſo ſhould they do: And above all theſe things, they ſhould put on Charity which is the Bond of Perfectneſs, and the Peace of God ſhould rule in their Hearts whereunto they are alſo called in one Body, Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. 15. As there is a repreſentation of the Body of Chriſt in this Ordinance of the Supper, ſo there is ſome ſignification of the Love and Unity that ought to be in the Body Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that is to ſay, the Church of Chriſt, the Apoſtles Words are plain, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 17. For we being many are one Bread and one Body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:95461:126"/>
            <p>You ſee <hi>how you are to prove your ſelves,</hi> and <hi>what queſtions</hi> to propound to your own ſouls, before you come to the Lords Table. And if your Conſciences can anſwer for you before God in the <hi>affirmative</hi> unto ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as theſe: You may without preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conclude that you are the Children of God, that you have a right to come to your Fathers Table, and that the Bread of Life belongs to you.</p>
            <p>In the Third place, I am to direct you <hi>how you may prove and call your ſelves to an account every day,</hi> that you may walk with the greater circumſpection.</p>
            <p>The God of Heaven is the Lord of Time, he obſerves how our Time is husbanded whether well or ill; and he can put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to it when he pleaſes. And if we did ſeriouſly obſerve what fills up our time, ſo many days would not be ſpent and loſt in ſin and vanity. It was an Heathen who ſaid, he <hi>had loſt a day,</hi> when a day paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing of good; which ſhews he uſed to reflect upon the actions of every day, whether they were Good or Evil. I would
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95461:126"/> adviſe you much to obſerve your ſelves. Never any more ſpend a day as if you were never to account for that day, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Eph. 5. 16. See then that ye walk circumſpectly not as fools but as wiſe Redeeming the Time.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives the like charge, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the Evening of the day, it will not be amiſs to retire, and laying aſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs to converſe with thy ſelf, and ask thy ſelf theſe or ſuch like queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Did I <hi>wake with God in the Morning, and in his ſtrength reſolve to walk with God all this day long?</hi> Every one of us ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me O God! When I awake I am ſtill with thee, Pſal.</hi> 139. 17, 18. The firſt Fruits of our Thoughts ſhould be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto God; and if the firſt Fruit be Holy, all the reſt of our Thoughts are the more likely to be free from wickedneſs and vanity. And as the ſoul ſhould be lifted up to the Lord at the very firſt unlocking of the ſenſes; ſo there ſhould be a reſolving
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95461:127"/> and forecaſting how to pleaſe and glorifie him. Every day we live, the main end of our living ſhould be minded; and that is to honour that God who is our Maker, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour, Saviour, <hi>for off him and through him, and to him are all things, and to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Glory for ever, Rom. 11. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Ask thy ſelf, <hi>Did I willingly leave my Bed that I might go to Prayer and ſearch the Word of God? And did I long for and enjoy Communion with God in theſe duties?</hi> Many will leave their Beds moſt readily, when they are to go a pleaſant Journey; or when they hope to drive on an advantagious bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; or when they are to put on their fineſt Clothes. But how few do ſhake off ſleep in a morning, that they may go to the Throne of Grace, where the trueſt, both pleaſure and profit is to be found. <hi>David</hi> lookt up to Heaven, aſſoon as his Eyes were open, <hi>Pſal. 5. 3. My Voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will look up.</hi> Nay he ſays, <hi>Pſal. 119. 147. I prevented the dawning of the Morning, and cryed, I hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy Word.</hi> Early Prayer and Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture is the way to obtain a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95461:127"/> bleſſing at the beginning of the day, the influence of which may be perceived all the day after. Communion with God in the morning may knit the Heart ſo faſt to him as that no Temptation may be able to draw it away from him afterwards.</p>
            <p>It was a pretty paſſage of <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Who read a Chapter when they riſe,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Prayer and looking ſeriouſly into the Word of God at firſt, is the way to keep Eyes and Heart, and Hands and Tongue, and feet, and all in order.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ask thy ſelf, <hi>Have I walked within my Houſe with a perfect Heart? Praying with them, Edifying of them, and giving no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence and ſtumbling to them?</hi> There will be the <hi>practiſe</hi> of Godlineſs in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> where there is really the <hi>power</hi> of Godlineſs in the <hi>Heart.</hi> Every Chriſtian Family ſhould be like <hi>Philemons, a Church, Philem. 2. 3. To the Church in thy Houſe, Grace and Peace from God our Father, and the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> A Church implies a joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95461:128"/> in that Worſhip and Service which God has commanded. Chriſtian Families being Churches there ought to be an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Family together to pour out joynt Prayers unto God. <hi>I and my Houſe we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> ſays good old <hi>Joſhua, Joſh. 24. 15. I know</hi> Abraham, ſays God, <hi>that he will command his Children, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 18. 19. Family Prayer is enjoyned in the Lords Prayer; <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> ſhews plainly that thoſe who ordinarily and daily eat together, ought ordinarily and daily to pray together. The Maſter of a Family has a great truſt committed to him, even all the Souls under his roof, and therefore by Praying with them and for them, by reading of the Holy Scripture, by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Inſtruction, and by an Holy and excellent example he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be beneficial to them, and all the members of the Family ſhould do the duties of their place and relation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Ask thy ſelf, <hi>Have I kept my Heart this day with all diligence?</hi> The wiſe man gives that precept, <hi>Prov. 4. 23. Keep thy Heart with all diligence:</hi> And every one
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95461:128"/> that is wiſe will follow it. The Heart is to be kept <hi>for</hi> God and Chriſt; there ſhould be a moſt joyful conſent, that the Father and the Son ſhould make their abode there: That the Word of God ſhould be <hi>hid</hi> there. And the Heart ſhould be kept <hi>from</hi> Sin and Satan, and this preſent evil World. Keep thy Heart, for without diligent keeping it will be like the ſluggards Field, nothing but what is ſtinking and noyſom will grow in it. Examine, Have the Thoughts of thy Heart been Holy? Has God been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, awfully, and delightfully thought on? Have thy Affections been Spiritual, and moſt ſtrongly inclined and carried forth, after Heavenly and Spiritual things? Has Pride, Envy, Anger, and Evil Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, and every other Heart Sin been hated? Upon the firſt appearance of ſuch Corruption, haſt thou preſently cryed to Heaven for help, and never ceaſed, till they were gotten under? The difficulty and alſo the excellency of the Chriſtian Religion lies in keeping the Heart pure; the Heart then is in no wiſe at any time to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Ask thy ſelf, <hi>Have I walked and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I might not enter into Temptation?</hi>

            <p>Calling your ſelves to an Account thus every day, will make the Authority of Conſcience to be more own'd and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced: The Heart will be the better kept within bounds when it knows it muſt be Catechiſed at Evening, and ſeverely chidden for every Tranſgreſſion.

And truly ſuch at the firſt view of themſelves may preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive whoſe they are: Satan works more openly in theſe ſcandalous Children of Diſobedience, and leads them Captive in the ſight of all. Their Curſing and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hating of Gods Word, and Sabbath, and Meſſengers; their Fornication and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery; their Stealing, Injuſtice and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; their Covetouſneſs and Drunkenneſs,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95461:136"/> and Railing at Religion, and Abhorring all that are ſerious. Theſe things are the Devils Badg and Livery, and plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ſuch perſon are in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of Iniquity.</hi> Oh you that <hi>declare your ſin as Sodom and hide it not.</hi> You cannot deny your wickedneſs pray be at laſt convinced of it, and think what will be the end of the courſe you are taking.</p>
            <p>Let theſe five words of advice be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look <hi>about you</hi> and ſee <hi>innumerable Evils compaſſing you about, Pſal. 40. 12.</hi> How vaſt is the number, how heinous the nature, and how high and horrid the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of your inquities! Your ſins are as <hi>Scarlet and Crimſon,</hi> indeed your <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes are grown up to the very Heavens,</hi> and notwithſtanding your great Abominations, you have been impudent and hardhearted: Your Necks have been like an Iron ſinew, and your Brows Braſs, and your Hearts like an Adamant-ſtone, you have refuſed to be aſhamed and to return: The leaſt of all your ſins is enough to damn you, and ſhould not the conſideration of ſo many,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95461:136"/> and ſuch great ones, daunt and fright you? That God who is to judge you, knows what you have done. He has <hi>compaſſed your Paths,</hi> has heard your <hi>words,</hi> has lookt into your <hi>Hearts,</hi> is <hi>acquainted with all your wayes, Pſal. 139. 1, 2, 3.</hi> And has not forgotten any of your evil works and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Let all this fill you with trouble and make you tremble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Look <hi>within you,</hi> and take notice of a Fountain of ſin there. The Lord that ſearches the Heart of man gives it a very bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. God ſaw that the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man was great upon the Earth, and every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only Evil continually.</hi> And Chriſt who knew what was in man, expreſſely tells us that out of <hi>the Heart of man proceed all the Evils whereby he is defiled, Matth. 15. 19, 20.</hi> Satan indeed is your Enemy and he ſhowes himſelf ſo in Tempting you to Evil; but all your ſins are properly your own Hearts Off-ſpring, the principal blame is to be laid at your own door. Your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted natures make you Devils, Tempters, Enemies to your ſelves, deſtroyers of your ſelves, <hi>Jam. 1. 14, 15. Every man is Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he is drawn away of his own luſt,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95461:137"/> and enticed; then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Look <hi>above you,</hi> and behold an angry God, a God angry particularly with you, and can you <hi>ſtand before his indignation?</hi> Take notice of the <hi>Mountains quaking, the Hills melting, the Rocks overturned, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Aſtoniſhed; the Devils trembling,</hi> when the Lord is Wrath, and do you think that you can proſper if you harden you ſelves againſt him? His <hi>Wrath is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of men, Rom.</hi> 1. 18. When that Wrath is felt; how heavy will it be found?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look <hi>beneath you,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> a flaming Furnace: Thats a dreadful fire indeed which never ſhall be quenched, which will always Torment, but never quite conſume, and make an end of thoſe that are burning in it. We read that ſinners muſt <hi>dwell with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings.</hi> Our Lord tells you that in Hell, <hi>the Worm dies not and the Fire is not quenched,</hi> and he ſays this thrice, nay,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95461:137"/> ſix times together, that man may believe and fear, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 43. 48. And into this <hi>Hell the wicked ſhall be turned, and all the Nations that forget God, Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. This is as certain, as 'tis certain God is true and Powerful and Juſt, and Holy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Look the very worſt of you <hi>into the Goſpel,</hi> and behold the Lord Jeſus ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his hand <hi>all the day long even to them that are Disobedient and Gain-ſaying, Rom.</hi> 10. 21. Stretching forth the hand, is as much as inviting ſinners to come to him, and offering Salvation to them. He has Juſtified and waſhed and ſanctified, and ſaved as bad as you. And if you will at length conſent to be ſanctified as well as ſaved, and come to him; he will do both for the moſt guilty and defiled among you. Oh! Look to Jeſus whom you have ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cry to be drawn to him!</p>
            <p>Secondly,</p>
            <p>Let meerly <hi>Moral men</hi> prove themſelves. Theſe have very great need to ſearch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they may not be undon for ever by ſelf-confidence. When I ſpeak of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95461:138"/> I do not mean an univerſal reſpect unto the precepts of the Moral Law, for ſuch a kind of reſpect, only thoſe who are truly Regenerate and Religious, yeild unto the Lords Commands. But by Morality I underſtand an external Righteouſneſs, and freedom from more groſs and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iniquities; ſuch a Moraliſt was the Phariſee, who ſaid, <hi>God I thank thee I am not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers, Luke</hi> 18. 11. And ſuch Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was to be found in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was Graceleſs before his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Touching the Righteouſneſs of the Law I was blameleſſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. Now Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon Examination may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but meerly moral, by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſigns.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meerly moral men are <hi>great ſtrangers to the Corruption of their own Natures.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they think, themſelves to be <hi>whole,</hi> and do not apprehend any neceſſity of a new Birth, of having a New Heart given to them. When <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the Phariſee came to Chriſt, Chriſt told him of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, <hi>That which is Born of the Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>except a man be Born
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95461:138"/> again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, Joh.</hi> 3. 3. 6. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> while a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee was <hi>alive</hi> in his own Thoughts, though really dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins. Moral men not knowing what they are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, continue ſecurely in a ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſuppoſe they have no need of the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, whereby alone they might be Juſtified and Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Meerly moral men, <hi>though blameleſs in their Lives, yet their Hearts are allowed to be wicked.</hi> The Phariſees of old were againſt actual Murther, but allowed of Malice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Revenge, they were free from groſs Adultery, but made nothing of Evil Concupiſcence. Therefore our Lord. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. does at large ſhew the ſpirituality and extent of the Law of God, and how it lays an obligation upon the very Heart, unto Purity and Meekneſs and Love, as well as requires external Conformity to the Letter of it in the Life and Converſation. What kind of Hearts have theſe Moral men? What Pride and high Thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what hatred is allowed to lodge in them? What Ignorance and Contempt of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95461:139"/> Communion with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt? How exceeding ſuitable and deſirable are the Wealth, Preferments, and Delights of this World, but their Hearts are meer ſtrangers unto the Love of God, and delight in him, and rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus: And which is worſt of all, they think this is needleſs, and that their Hearts are ſo good they need not be changed and made better.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Meerly Moral men <hi>do reſt</hi> in <hi>their own External Righteouſneſs, and reſt</hi> upon <hi>it.</hi> They are confident that <hi>good living,</hi> and giving every man his due, is enough; though the mean while the World, and the God of this World fill their Hearts. They act as if that Precept were not in the Bible, <hi>My Son give me thy Heart, Prov.</hi> 23. 26. As if they had never read of <hi>Davids</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, <hi>Pſal. 25. 1. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my Soul.</hi> And as they reſt <hi>in</hi> their own external Righteouſneſs, as if inward Holineſs were not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo they reſt and rely <hi>upon</hi> it, as if this were enough to juſtifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and to purchaſe their acceptance and Salvation: But this ruines them, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95461:139"/> cuts them ſhort of the Righteouſneſs of the Son of God, <hi>Rom. 10. 3, 4. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God, for Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that Beleiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you meerly moral men may know your ſelves. And oh! That you would be adviſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Conſider that <hi>Morality can neither juſtifie it ſelf nor you;</hi> It cannot juſtifie it <hi>ſelf</hi> becauſe 'tis meerly external, a piece of Pageantry and Hypocriſie for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purity, and how then can it juſtifie <hi>you</hi> before that God who is ſo glorious in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; You certainly ſtand in need of Chriſt as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners in the World, and muſt needs to Hell without Him. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a great Moraliſt before he was a Chriſtian, but when his Eyes were open, Chriſt was valued as the onely Juſtifier and Saviour of ſinful and loſt man, and ſays he, I deſire to <hi>be found in Him not having my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:95461:140"/>2. Pray that the <hi>Commandment may come with Power,</hi> and ſhew your ſins even thoſe that lye hid in your very Hearts, and make you ſenſible of your damned and loſt Eſtate, <hi>Rom. 7. 9. I was alive without the Law once but when the Commandement came ſin revived and I died.</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my confidence of my Goodneſs and good Eſtate before I ſaw my ſelf by Law a condemned and dead man, and no hope of life without Jeſus a Mediatour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be ſenſible of the <hi>neceſſity of the New-Birth, and cry for the Spirit.</hi> Thoſe that are born again are born of the Spirit of God, <hi>Joh. 3. 6. That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> This Spirit God is willing to give to all that ask him, ſeeing indeed their need of him. Begg hard for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that by him you may be <hi>enlightned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin,</hi> and ſet at <hi>Liberty</hi> from it, that you may be drawn to Chriſt, and <hi>changed into the glorious image of God,</hi> which does conſiſt not in Righteouſneſs meerly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but in Righteouſneſs and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:95461:140"/>
            <p>Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Let <hi>unſound Profeſſors</hi> prove themſelves. Why ſhould ſuch entertain a confidence which the Lord will reject? Why ſhould they joyn with a ſubtle Serpent to deceive themſelves? Oh! that they would bring their baſe mettal to the Touchſtone, that they may perceive how vaſtly it differs from pure and tried Gold. And that they would weigh themſelves in the balance of the Sanctuary, that their Conſciences may perceive what reaſon there is that <hi>Tekel,</hi> ſhould be written upon them, they are <hi>weighed in the balance and are found utterly wanting.</hi> Now unſound Profeſſors may come this way to a <hi>Conviction</hi> of their own unſoundneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They <hi>cannot endure plain dealing.</hi> Our Lord tells us that this is the Worlds fault and <hi>Condemnation, that they love darkneſs rather then light becauſe their Deeds are Evil. Joh.</hi> 3. 19. And unſound Profeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not really come out of the World, no wonder if the Word be diſguſted, that diſcovers and reproves them. <hi>Sharp reproof</hi> makes us <hi>ſound in the Faith, Tit.</hi> 1. 13. But ſuch rebukes the unſound cannot bear. <hi>Deal
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95461:141"/> gently</hi> ſaid <hi>David with the Young Man Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lont,</hi> And this is the Hypocrites Language. <hi>Deal gently with my Pride, and ſelfiſhneſs, and darling luſts, and ſinful compliance for ſafety, and profit, and preferment ſake.</hi> It ſhews they are bruitiſh and void of true underſtanding becauſe reproof is hated, <hi>Prov. 12. 1. He that hateth reproof is bruitiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Unſound Profeſſours <hi>regard iniquity in their Hearts.</hi> Shame and Fear, and hope of repute among men, may curb and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from running into the act of ſin, but the inward Love to it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mortified. It may truly be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Hypocrite, <hi>he abhorreth not evil, Pſal.</hi> 36. 4. He may upon ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be afraid and aſhamed to commit ſin, but he does not hate and abhor to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin. He ſecretly loves ſome ſin or other, though he hides, both his ſin and his love to it, he does not long for the Death of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Unſound Profeſſours <hi>carry on Carnal deſigns in their profeſſion of Religion,</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſuch is made ſometime a cloak to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, or to Concupiſcence, or to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs; they do not deſign the pleaſing and glorifying of God; <hi>this end</hi> ſways not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95461:141"/> with the Heart till Grace is wrought there. But they profeſs Godlineſs, that they may ſin the more plauſibly and unſuſpectedly, and that they may bring about their ſelfiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the more cleverly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Unſound Profeſſours do <hi>reliſh only the things of the Fleſh,</hi> which ſhews that they are after the Fleſh. <hi>Rom. 8. 5. They that are after the Fleſh do mind the things of the Fleſh, and they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</hi> They ſavour not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, neither are they troubled at the Carnality of their minds and affections, nor do they deſire to be made ſpiritually minded:</p>
            <p>Now you who are thus convicted to be Hypocritical and unſound Profeſſours, I beſeech you remember.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God looks into you,</hi> He that hates ſin moſt perfectly and will puniſh it moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, knows how ſinful you are. If all things are open and naked to his view, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he looks into the painted and <hi>whited ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,</hi> and beholds, all the filthineſs and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs that is within it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:95461:142"/>2. Hypocriſie is <hi>very hateful to God,</hi> His Eye and Knowledge is diſregarded by the Hypocrite; his hand is not feared, his Grace and Goodneſs horribly contemned and abuſed. And all this the Hypocrite does to Gods very face, in his very Houſe, while he is bowing the knee before him, and giving a great many good words to him, and ſeems very devout in his ſervice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hypocriſie will <hi>be at laſt detected.</hi> When thou art diſtracted by a Diſeaſe, or wounded in thy Conſcience thou mayſt be forced to confeſs, thy Injuſtice, Impurity, and other Abominations: But if this be not at the laſt day all will come out to thy Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Contempt and Confuſion. <hi>For God will bring every work into Judgement with every ſecret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 14. Be wiſe therefore O unſound Profeſſors! Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not with God, deceive not your ſelves, conſent at laſt to be ſearched and ſanctified, and being humbled and aſhamed becauſe of your deceitful dealing with the Lord, and Religion; pray to be made <hi>Iſraelites indeed in whom there is no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="267" facs="tcp:95461:142"/>
            <p>Fourthly,</p>
            <p>Let <hi>ſincere Saints</hi> prove themſelves. I have at large given you before the Characters of them who are Saints in ſincerity. They may know themſelves by their <hi>coming out from the World,</hi> by their <hi>preferring the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true and Everlaſting God, in their choice, before all Lying and Dying Vanities,</hi> by their <hi>thankful acceptance of the Lord Jeſus as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and Redeemer from all iniquity, as well as from the wrath that is to come.</hi> Finally they may be known by their <hi>deſires after the Grace of God in Truth, and to be cleanſed from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs in the Fear of God.</hi> Now you who are thus really ſanctified I would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Acknowledge that <hi>the Grace of God has made you what you are,</hi> that you are Called, Juſtified, Adopted, changed into the Image of your heavenly Father, is owing to the rich and glorious Grace of God. This makes the difference between the Children of God, and the Children of Diſobedience. <hi>What have you that you have not received? 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 7. And what have you receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but what you were in your ſelves utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unworthy to receive?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:95461:143"/>2. Be ſenſible that <hi>that Grace which has begun muſt perfect that which does concern you.</hi> That picture which was begun by <hi>Apelles</hi> could not be perfected by the hand of any other. <hi>Look</hi> therefore unto the <hi>Author to be the finiſher of your Faith, Heb.</hi> 12. 2. And truly you are encouraged to a more firm relyance, by what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil. 1. 6. Being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Do nothing <hi>unbecoming your preſent State and Relation, and future hopes.</hi> You are <hi>highly favoured, the Lord is with you.</hi> You are advanced to be the <hi>Children of the Lord Almighty,</hi> to be the <hi>Heirs of Life</hi> and Glory, and <hi>Joint-heirs with Chriſt</hi> himſelf, to be <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God.</hi> Let there be an Holy Majeſty in your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, rejoice and work Righteouſneſs. Count it below you to be proud and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded; below you to mind Earthly things, or to do any thing that looks like ſerving Sin and Satan.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Having attained unto peace <hi>take heed of breaking it.</hi> Aſſurance may much more
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95461:143"/> eaſily be loſt then gained. There muſt be all diligence to get it; but negligence may loſe it. After the Prince of Peace has ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thy Heart, and ſaid <hi>Peace, be ſtill.</hi> Oh! do nothing to raiſe a new ſtorm and tempeſt in thy Conſcience. But walk very humbly and cloſely with God. That you may live in the trueſt ſenſe pleaſant lives. And may come at laſt to Heaven, which is indeed the <hi>fair Haven</hi> in a bleſſed Calm; and that of the Pſalmiſt may be verified in you, <hi>Pſal. 37. 37. Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I finiſhed this Subject of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> a Duty which the Ungodly mind not, which Hypocrites are afraid and do not care to meddle with, and which if Saints would more frequently and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage in, there would be leſs unbelief and fear, more joy and Faith in the Church of Chriſt. You that are <hi>Saints,</hi> In this diſcourſe I have been <hi>helping of your Joy.</hi> Let it not be hindred by your ſelves. Some cluſters of <hi>Canaan</hi> might be brought to the Wilderneſs, and more of Heavens joys might be taſted in the Vale of Tears, if the Heirs of Heaven would but take more pains
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95461:144"/> in ſelf-trial, to clear up their Title. And as for you that are <hi>Hypocrites and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers,</hi> I have don you a kindneſs in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you what you are, and what you may expect hereafter. If after all, you will put a cheat upon your own ſouls; you muſt be blamed and your ſelves muſt ſmart for it. If you <hi>will</hi> cry <hi>peace and ſafety,</hi> till Chriſt himſelf does thunder that ſentence in your ears; <hi>Go ye Curſed into Everlaſting fire;</hi> Who can help it? Alas! Alas! 'Twill be too late to look up to Heaven, and to look into your ſelves, when the Gulph is fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and you. Let every ſinner therefore try his own ways, and cry to the Lord, to ſearch, and change, and turn his Heart. For 'tis the greateſt Wiſdom to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> thoſe miſtakes, which will be the <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Eternal ruine,</hi> and which after death will be found impoſſible to be <hi>corrected.</hi>

               <p>Thou art amazed to ſee thy iniquities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and thy Treſpaſſe grown up to the Heavens: Thou art aſtoniſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and horribly afraid to ſee how <hi>high thy ſin ſtrikes,</hi> even at God himſelf. But withal take notice how Chriſt who is God
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95461:154"/> does <hi>ſtoop and humble himſelf.</hi> He that thought it no Robbery to be equal with God the Father, takes upon him the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and becomes obedient to death even the Death of the Croſſe, and he is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make peace.</p>
